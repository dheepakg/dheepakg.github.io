      <description>Certifications are a waste of time. It&amp;rsquo;s not unreasonable as I came across dumps (aka recent questions, question banks). Once you memorize the contents of the question bank, you can score cent percent. Memorise answers and recall them in the exam hall, score a pass mark - a common theme in schools and colleges. I went through it as there are no alternatives. But in the post-academic stage of life, I was hesitant to follow the same approach in office.</description>
