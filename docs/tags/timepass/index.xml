      <description>Podcast is a audio show, could be anythingranging from interviews to discussions to story telling. The Podcasts became a thing with the iPods. Even the term itself derived from the Apple&amp;rsquo;s gadget. Off late, with the arrival of 3rd party apps, more people from Android are attracted, along with the Apple users.
In Apple, iTunes enables us to listen to Podcast. Google released their own app very recently and the customization is very limited.</description>
