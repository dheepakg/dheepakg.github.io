      <description>Amidst the second wave of COVID, a data analyst receives a tweet questioning a discrepancy. The data analyst is quite popular in the state for his daily analysis of COVID case count and 15k+ people following him.
One of the questions was about a blip in the stats provided by authorities. My friend raised the question,
Is there any false count happening with Coimbatore covid cases!!! There is addition of around 200 cases over night to the active cases in treatment count.</description>
