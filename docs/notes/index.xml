      <description>This is about The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel, a Columnist. This book became a sensation in the #fintwit. Many tweeters recommended the book and I preordered it on Amazon.
        Cover page    The book is crisp - 240 pages grouped into 20 chapters, each having few stories to explain actions behind money decisions.
