<li>
<p>An adult&rsquo;s owlness or larkness, also known as their chronotype is strongly determined by genetics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our 24-hour circadian rhythm determines wake and sleep cycle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While we are awake, a chemical called <em>adenosine</em> gets built up in our brain. It&rsquo;ll continue to increase in concentration with every single waking minute. One consequence of increasing adenosine in the brain is an increasing desire to sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Caffeine - artificially mute sleep signal of adenosine, by making us more alert and awake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Caffeine is second most traded commodity after <em>oil</em>. It is widely used as psychoactive stimulant in the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Caffeine works by successfully battling with <em>adenosine</em> for the privilege of latching on to adenosine receptors. Caffeine inactivates receptors, acting as a masking agent. It&rsquo;s equivalent of sticking our fingers in your ears to shut out a sound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Caffeine has an average half-life of five to seven hours. <em>Half-life</em> refers to length of time it takes for the body to remove 50% of drug&rsquo;s concentration.</p>

<li>
<p>NREM sleep - Non-rapid Eye Movement sleep; REM sleep - Rapid Eye Movement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NREM sleep - Dominates early in night. Weeds out and removes unnecessary neural connection. Helps transfer and makes safe newly learned information into long-term storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REM sleep - Prevails later in night. Dreaming stage. Strengthens connections between neurons. Collides freshly minted memories with entire back catalog of our life&rsquo;s autobiography.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you wake up earlier, you compromise REM sleep - forming memory will be impacted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you sleep late at night, it affects NREM sleep - getting rid of toxins/unnecessary neural connection gets impacted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evolution outlaws muscle activity during REM sleep - thereby prevents acting out on our dream experience.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>Its discovered that very simplest forms of unicellular organisms that survive for periods exceeding 24 hours, such as bacteria, have active and passive phases that correspond to the light-dark cycle of our planet. It is believed this is precursor of our own circadian rhythm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-dreaming stage - NREM is being experienced by every species.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sleep deprivation - Sleep duration is far longer on the recovery night than a standard night without sleep deprivation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The brain will consume a far larger portion of deep NREM sleep than REM sleep on the first night after sleep deprivation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you sleep in unfamiliar environment, one half of brain sleeps a little lighter than the other, as if it&rsquo;s standing guard with just a tad more vigilance due to potentially less safe context that the conscious brain has registered while awake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Siesta - An afternoon rest/nap, one taken during hottest hours of the day in a hot climate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Biphasic sleep is observed in several cultures throughout the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time we spend asleep is markedly shorter than all other primates. Between 20 - 25 percent of our sleep time is dedicated to REM sleep dreaming compared to an average of only 9 percent across all other primates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REM - Creates mnemonic collisions during REM sleep spark new creative insights as novel links are forged between unrelated pieces of information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="changes-in-sleep-across-the-life-span">Changes in sleep across the life span</h2>
<ol start="23">
<li>
<p>Prior to birth, and soon after, the challenge for development was to build and add vast number of neural highways and interconnections that become a fledgling brain. So, the REM sleep dominates the sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During late childhood and adolescence, the goal is to rewire the connections for effectiveness and efficiency. NREM sleep gets equal importance during this phase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the primary activity of NREM is to synaptic pruning, very prominent in adolescent period. This results in adolescents have a less rational version of an adult brain, one that takes more risks and has relatively poor decision making skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Older adults needs lesser sleep is a <em>myth</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The part of brain that ignite healthy deep sleep at night are the very same areas that degenerate earliest as we age.</p>

<li>
<p>Sleep is not the absence of wakefulness, it is far more than that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sleep before learning refreshes our ability to initially make new memories, it does so each and every night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sleeping after learning helps memory to click &lsquo;save&rsquo; button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After full night&rsquo;s sleep, brain fetches information from neocortex - region that serves as the long-term storage site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even daytime naps (as short as 20 mins) can offer a memory consolidation advantage, so long as they contain enough NREM sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Inemuri</em> - a Japanese term for unintentional public napping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sleep was far more intelligent than we previously thought. Sleep is able to offer a far more discerning hand in memory improvement: one that preferentially picks and chooses what information is, and in not, ultimately strengthened.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REM sleep presents us with outlandish memory blending.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="too-extreme-for-the-guinness-book-of-world-records">Too Extreme for the Guinness Book of World Records</h2>
<ol start="36">
<li>
<p>The momentary lapse in concentration due to sleep deprivation is termed as <em>microsleep</em>. During microsleep, our brain becomes blind to the outside world for brief moment - not just visual domain, but in all channels of perception.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We do not know how sleep-deprived we are when we are sleep-deprived.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After 16 hours of being awake, the brain begins to fail. Human needs more than seven hours of sleep each night to maintain cognitive performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drunk drivers are late to apply brake; but when sleep deprived, microsleep sets in and we lose ability to react altogether.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without sleep we lose ability to balance emotional impulse(anygdala) and rationality(prefrontal cortex).</p>

<p>Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is associated with the buildup of a toxic form of protein called beta-amyloid, which aggregates in sticky clumps or plaques within the brain. Amyloid plaques are poisonous to neurons, killing the surrounding brain cells.</p>

<li>
<p>In a healthy individual, the hormone insulin will trigger the cells of your body to swiftly absorb glucose from the bloodstream should it increase, as happens after eating a meal. Instructed by insulin, the cells of your body will open special channels on their surface that operate like wonderfully efficient roadside drains at the height of a downpour. They have no problem dealing with the deluge of glucose coursing down the transit arteries, avert ing what could otherwise be a dangerous flood of sugar in the bloodstream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From a metabolic perspective, the sleep-restricted participants had lost their hunger control. By limiting these individuals to what some in our society would think of as a &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; amount of sleep (five hours a night), Van Cauter had caused a profound imbalance in the scales of hormonal food desire. By muting the chemical message that says &ldquo;stop eating&rdquo; (leptin), yet increasing the hormonal voice that shouts &ldquo;please keep eating&rdquo; , your appetite remains unsatisfied when you sleep is anything less than plentiful, even after a kingly meal. As Va Cauter has elegantly described to me, a sleep-deprived body will c famine in the midst of plenty.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was not the time that heals all wounds, but rather time spent in dream sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can accurately relive the memory but we do not experience the same visceral reaction that was present and imprinted at the time of the episode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the brain cannot divorce the emotion from memory across the first night following a trauma experience, the theory suggests that a repeat attempt of emotional memory stripping will occur on the second night, as the strength of &ldquo;emotional tag&rdquo; associated with memory remains too high.
If the process fails second time, the same attempt will continue to repeat the next night, and the next night, like a broken record.
This was precisely what appeared to be happening with recurring nightmares of the trauma experience in PTSD patients.</p>

<p>Reality and perceived reality were no longer same in the &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; of the sleepless brain.</p>
