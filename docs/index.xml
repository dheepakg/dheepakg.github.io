      <description>E-Commerce, eBooks, Prime Video &amp;amp; music even for some AWS. This is the list of items that my close surroundings say about Amazon&amp;rsquo;s domain. Kindle is mostly overlooked or not prominently known among people.
Kindle is a strange product from Amazon. Unlike its Video/music or retail site, Kindle appeals to a narrow circle - readers. Even among the readers, there is a split between ebook and physical book readers.
Firstly, it&amp;rsquo;s the only hardware product from Amazon.</description>

      <description>Certifications are a waste of time. It&amp;rsquo;s not unreasonable as I came across dumps (aka recent questions, question banks). Once you memorize the contents of the question bank, you can score cent percent. Memorise answers and recall them in the exam hall, score a pass mark - a common theme in schools and colleges. I went through it as there are no alternatives. But in the post-academic stage of life, I was hesitant to follow the same approach in office.</description>

      <description>Here, I want to discuss about an unexpected outcome from interview. Contrary to the &amp;lsquo;rona times, I felt happy and contented.
The interview is usually a stressful affair. I usually prepare 100s of topics, then the interviewer will bombard me with 101st topic. Well, its just a déjà vu, nothing new with the session.
The interviewer was friendly and made me absolutely comfortable, there were no stress-inducing questions, all through the entire discussion.</description>

      <description>In this write up, the hostel is used to indicate not only limited to the boarding school but also staying away from parents.
TL;DR You must live in a hostel.
All through these years since your arrival, you&amp;rsquo;ve a safety net named parents. They cleaned your shitty bums, they fed you with the food that are handpicked for your well-being, they were there when you tumbled down, they taught you how to walk, eat, pee et al.</description>

      <description>Social Media is a petri dish, culturing cultured and uncultured humans in real time. Based on your followers and taste you develop your own bubble, reinforce the bubble&amp;rsquo;s collective thought and at some point of time you&amp;rsquo;ll start believing it.
One way to not get lost in the rabbit hole is to think the collective thought (trending topic) is wrong and trying to justify it. Then I came across this &amp;lsquo;-pride&amp;rsquo; posts.</description>

      <description>Emails became so much intertwined in our daily life. Whatever the internet service it be, eventually it comes to identifying you only through your email1. The newsletters used to be my source of information. I gradually unsubscribed to newsletters and marked the providers as important in my everyday feed of Twitter &amp;amp; Facebook.

      <description>The future generations must be viewing this as a biggest psychological experiment, worst case scenario and the inhumane practice to save humanity and much more. This is COVID-19 lockdown.
Lockdown was imposed on March 25th 2020. Being a social animal, we went through a lot. The ill effects of lockdown ranges from anxiety induced due to potential job loss - historic unemployment rate, potential downturn of investments in coming years, struggling to keep up with daily work-from-home with it&amp;rsquo;s own challenges.</description>

Let&amp;rsquo;s start with little about me . I like to read books. As of today, reading is one of the hobby for me. For her, reading is a boring chore, like majority around me.

There are few things, worth mentioning here, both positive &amp;amp; negative.

      <description>Last July marks the Quadrennial year working in an MNC. These years had taught me several valuable lessons. Learnt either from first-hand experience or learning from others action. What I learnt is that our fundamentals are flawed as several important things are not taught at young age.
There are 2 important things that must be included in curriculum.
Career vs. Job : In earlier generation, its pride to be working with an employer for long duration (say, in terms years or decades).</description>

Should have called the water can vendor if I reached home came earlier. He did delivered the cans after a call and waiting for a hour.
Breakfast time. Rushed out to road-side eatery. While waiting for dishes to be prepared, had conversation with the owner-cum-server, came to know that the continuous rain for 3 days the last week has affected their business.</description>

First part of above sentence is objectively denotes ‘WiFi’. The second part contextually denotes ‘WiFi’ through the word – ‘it’.
According Merriam-Webster, Context is defined as,
 The parts of a discourse that surround a word or passage and can throw light on its meaning
 Every tech giant is boasting that their digital assistants can understand our contextual conversation. Indeed it is a big step for machines to understand our natural speech.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Raspberry Pi running in home, for last 10 months. Until a month ago, the sole purpose of the RPi is to filter off the ads using Pi-hole1, then a speed test module was scheduled to run on it. By the setup, the speedtest-cli runs every 10 mins and fetches internet into csv file.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with Big data since 2017. As I&amp;rsquo;m from data warehousing background, it was easier for me to understand what&amp;rsquo;s what, and build an analogy between DWH &amp;amp; big data frameworks. However, the various file formats used in HDFS always caught me off guard.
In DWH, I never considered how the files are stored in DB, it&amp;rsquo;s managed by the database, maybe DBA might know how its done at the backend, as a DB developer it never bothered me.</description>

      <description>The 2010&amp;rsquo;s was my 20&amp;rsquo;s. I was in the middle of under graduate course when the decade begun. An average engineering graduate who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what engineering really was or what&amp;rsquo;s the future is offering. The end of year marks the recruitment to my current employer. Yes right, I&amp;rsquo;m with the employer for almost a decade.
IIRC 13k was my 1st my first salary. Couldn&amp;rsquo;t recall how I spent it, guess gave it to my mom.</description>

      <description>The generation born between 1985-95 has more or less seen the technology evolution from the fron seat. The advent of internet, landline giving up its place to mobile phones, more desk jobs than the labour intensive work. Through this journey, the lifestyle got altered to a large extent. Some of the changes are just an improvemnt to our life, while some or controversial in nature. I call them controversial as harmful effects are neither proved nor denied by scientific community.</description>

      <description>My primary source of Python and Python related news was/is Python podcast, since 2016. In 2018, I came to know about Pycon taking place in Cleveland, OH. Dan Bader&amp;rsquo;s vlog on PyCon &amp;lsquo;18 was another pull factor towards the PyCon. Due to the ticket pricing I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it to it. In H2 of 2018, I returned to India, and was looking forward to attend PyConIndia, which should be affordable.</description>

      <description>Variables
In Python, the variables are assigned with the type based on the content.
string_variable = &amp;#39;some text&amp;#39; int_variable = 33 print(type(string_variable), type(int_variable)) And, these variables are allowed to change in a program.
In Rust, the variables can either be mutable or immutable. By default, the variables are immutable.
 Mutable - Values are allowed to change Immutable - Values are not allowed to change
 fn main() { let default_variable = 2; println!</description>

      <description>Podcasts. That&amp;rsquo;s how I got introduced to the Rust language.
In one of the PythonBytes episode I heard about the PyOxidizer for the first time. Basically, it uses Rust to bundle Python code into an executable code. There is already quite a number of modules to convert code into an executable file. According to Michael Kennedy, the Git repo is so active, that made me to explore what the PyOxidizer is made of.</description>

      <description>The social media is made of several bubbles. The bubbles, each of us build around us, with like minded people. With the bubble is well constructed, we live and slowly start believing it is the reflection of the actual world.
This is what happened to me in recent times. There is some negative news keep getting shared to me via whatsapp, twitter or facebook. The negativity comes in the form of political corruption to pedophilia.</description>

      <description>Podcast is a audio show, could be anythingranging from interviews to discussions to story telling. The Podcasts became a thing with the iPods. Even the term itself derived from the Apple&amp;rsquo;s gadget. Off late, with the arrival of 3rd party apps, more people from Android are attracted, along with the Apple users.
In Apple, iTunes enables us to listen to Podcast. Google released their own app very recently and the customization is very limited.</description>

      <description>We all know the Climate change is real and happening now. This is a threat to the Human species. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s a threat to the species not the entire planet. Why not we as a species cannot survive this? The nature will adapt to the changes. But, the new earth will no way close to the one we have now. Also, we got deviated from the natural evolution. Our life became sophisticated, without the necessary infrastructure we will kill ourself in the name of depression.</description>

      <description>While browsing through Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s sub in Reddit, I came across Pi-hole.
Pi-hole is an interesting project, claims to be black hole of Ads. I guess the pi in the name refers to Raspberry Pi. As my Pi3 was lying in the corner unused, I went for the Pi-hole installation. Before continuing further on the experience, we need to discuss why the ads are bothering?
What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with ads? I agree the ads are the revenue source of websites.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working in a corporate firm which employs 100K+ employees. As do with any organization of such a magnitude, there are certain rules &amp;amp; policies which cannot be breached. In most of the occasions, the policies really help us navigate without much of the issue. Yet, there are situations which impedes our progress.
The impedement I felt was merging PDF files. What&amp;rsquo;s there to worry about, you may wonder. In our org, we have some version of Adobe Reader to view PDFs.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s cool to have a personal website. As a novice, where to start? The cheapest, practical and programmatic option is Github Pages
Cheapest - Free to use GH Pages. You may not get a dedicated domain, but you&amp;rsquo;ll get a name.github.io
Practical - You can go for blogger or wordPress for writing a blog post. However, you&amp;rsquo;ll never get to experience the nitty-gritty involved with running an actual website.
Programmatic - Once you started programming, it will be intriguing to learn something new.</description>

      <description>As a country, 1990&amp;rsquo;s are changing times for India. The nation saw some of the interesting transformations, which would be an unimaginable tale even a decade earlier for Geo-political experts. The changes ranges from Economic stance of the country to opening up to private cable channels to introduction of Internet to the masses (the snail-paced dial-ups).
The election commission too hopped into the transformation train. From the conventional paper based ballot, the Electronic Voting Machines were introduced.</description>

      <description>This is a new site built on Jekyll, hosted on GitHub.
I came across the GitHub Pages. As the flow looks intriguing, I&amp;rsquo;m trying out this. As a blogger I tried out Wordpress, Blogspot and Medium. The interest to compose a post fizzles out very often. However, I&amp;rsquo;m trying harder to reverse the trend.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see how it goes.</description>

      <title>Final frontier for AI could be decoding Sarcasm</title>

      <description>Sarcasm, according to Google is “ the use of irony to mock or convey contempt”. Interpreting it could be final frontier for AI.
Understanding Sarcastic line is a complex process. Depends on lots of variables — context, body language, tone modulation and so on. To be fair there is not proper/scientific way to decode sarcasm. To add to it, degree of closeness is (kinda) proportional to complexity of sarcasm.
In one of the scene Deadpool 2 movie, the lead actor was questioned who he is.</description>

      <description>Occupation (for-profit) or welfare/charity (non-profit)?
This is the question which started a long conversation with my friend over Whatsapp.
Why does it matter? Everything depends on the answer. If it’s Occupation, you can tax them for the revenue, likewise you can insure them so they can land safe in times of tragedy. Or if its a welfare, government can take it or some NGOs can chip in with funding from benevolent sponsors.</description>

      <description>I’m a big fan of Democratic government. Went to war, in cyber world, with my friends whenever they say Saudi Arabia/China style of government is better than D-government. I’m pro-democracy because I believe in free will of humans.
So far, every dictator has ruled the people, crushed the basic rights in the name of religion, communism, socialism et al. We are not animals to be herded by some dictator. On the other end of spectrum, we have democracy.</description>

      <description>Some woah things.. Stop searching for your passion #   Passion is a feeling, not a plan. And Feeling&amp;rsquo;s change. Not everything you do needs to fit into your &amp;ldquo;passion&amp;rdquo;. Just try things. Go out there and try things. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if your career isn&amp;rsquo;t something you want to do for the rest of your life.   </description>
