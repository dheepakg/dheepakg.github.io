&lt;!-- The history -->
&lt;h1 id="my-pov">My PoV&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I started following the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@muthaleetukalam">channel&lt;/a> during the lockdown, just like million other self-proclaimed investors. The channel is not for trader/speculator/FnO players or gamblers. The videos pops up everyday since the lockdown times. The primary theme is investor behavior, or current events with respect of finance or economics. Some day special guests gets featured, to share their experience.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Event Update: Consecration</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/08/event-update-consecration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/08/event-update-consecration/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m in the midway between an atheist, agnostic and a religious person. My particiaption in events based out of religious tradition, is almost always doubtful. Yet, I was part of this community gathering, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to cover the event.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- What it is and when? -->
&lt;p>When a temple gets built, it deserves sequence of rituals that adds spiritual and religious power to the deity living in the temple. As it is a belief based system, logical questioing doesn&amp;rsquo;t end well. The event took place on August 17-19, 2024.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
