&lt;h2 id="how-i-was-deploying-it-earlier">How I was deploying it earlier?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I used to have 2 commits for any changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Changes to the posts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>HTML documents generated through &lt;code>hugo&lt;/code> command&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="what-was-the-problem-there">What was the problem there?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The major problem is the process involves 2 steps. Sometimes, I used to forget generating HTML docs and the changes never flow into the static site.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Longreads with Kindle</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2021/05/longreads-with-kindle/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 May 2021 21:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2021/05/longreads-with-kindle/</guid><description>&lt;p>E-Commerce, eBooks, Prime Video &amp;amp; music even for some AWS. This is the list of items that my close surroundings say about Amazon&amp;rsquo;s domain. Kindle is mostly overlooked or not prominently known among people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kindle is a strange product from Amazon. Unlike its Video/music or retail site, Kindle appeals to a narrow circle - readers. Even among the readers, there is a &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/which-is-better-ebooks-or-paper-books-1625005600">split&lt;/a> between ebook and physical book readers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Firstly, it&amp;rsquo;s the only hardware product from Amazon. The hardware is not some cheap plastic. The device boasts a solid design, handy to carry around, easier to handle in a single hand. The battery is one of the key factors, once fully charged the device runs for weeks.
.Secondly, unlike other products Kindle helps us to build a constructive habit - reading. Third, once you acquire Kindle you can circumvent Amazon entirely and no need to pay. The hardware superiority and goodness of reading have been covered by so many blogs. Here, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how I&amp;rsquo;m using Kindle to use Kindle.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
