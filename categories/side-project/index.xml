This post is a follow up to the pervious post on various tools used to build the process of building the application
The Environment Core language used in our project is Python. Python is used to fetch details from API calls, cleaning the API return value, and also writing it into DB.

Instead of building a spaghetti code that just works, we are approaching the entire process through the industry practise.
For example, the working components are modularised for easier maintenance. These individual modules are built on TDD approach, testing with every step of our development. The test results are passed through coverage to understand how much code is covered under our testing process.</description></item><item><title>Project Update - 1</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/01/project-update-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 12:22:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/01/project-update-1/</guid><description>Everyone of us think(or worry) about future, especially in 30s.
