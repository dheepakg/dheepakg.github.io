The things she learns and the way she communicates is intriguing me. To be frank, I believe almost every kid does the same, more or less. But as I am seeing her development from very close I do observe on how she learns.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- 1. Imitatates what an elder does. repeating -->
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Imitation&lt;/strong>: She imitates us. Whatever we do she tries to replicate us. For example, she tries to saute the imaginary food on her toy kitchen set.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;!-- 2. Does learn from everyone, adult, elder sibling, animals, birds. No ego. -->
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>No Ego&lt;/strong>: They doesn&amp;rsquo;t decide on whom to copy from. She mimics what her cousin does. The cousin we are talking about is barely an year old. She sees something new, she copis it; no discrimination on age.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;!-- 3. Questions without thinking what others will think -->
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Not thinking what others thinking&lt;/strong>: She doesn&amp;rsquo;t consider what others thinking. Isn&amp;rsquo;t it this factor stops us from doing what we love. Having said that, sometimes she screams in public place irritating fellow beings.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;!-- 4. Pattern matching. Kinnam vs kannam -->
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Identifying patterns&lt;/strong>: Numbers are abstract concept for a toddler. Yet, on saying 3, she runs. Its more like a pattern matching than understanding 1-2-3.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;!-- 5. Observing all the time -->
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Observing all the time&lt;/strong>: There is no dedicated learning time for her. She just goes on to observer and mimic all the time.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
