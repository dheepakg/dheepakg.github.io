&lt;p>One thing I admire about &lt;a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian&lt;/a> is its Graph view. I was imagining how it will look like if we make a similar graph view with the blogposts, its categories, and tags.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="graph-view.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- Imagine how it will look like when cat-tag-post are linked-->
&lt;!-- How to do that -->
&lt;p>The similar graph is available in the &lt;a href="https://logseq.com/">Logseq&lt;/a> as well. I was going through the Logseq&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://github.com/logseq/logseq">repos&lt;/a> to understand how the graph was built. It was using clojure which is beyond my knowledge.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>IPL: Ways to see beyond Scoreboard - Part 2</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2025/06/ipl-ways-to-see-beyond-scoreboard-part-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2025/06/ipl-ways-to-see-beyond-scoreboard-part-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Finally, it&amp;rsquo;s completed.

&lt;!-- Road blocks; how its handled -->
&lt;p>The learning from this activity is quite a long list.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Visualization is easier compared to data collection &amp;amp; preparation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>UI is scarier than the backend stuff like terminal or notebooks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prototyping is very much important, especially for the hobby project.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Iterative improvement is greater than aiming for a polished shiny thing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Presentation is key&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

The graphics published in sites like FT, Reuters, or NYT made me wonder why I don&amp;rsquo;t spend time on the skill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The good volume and variety of data that is available is available all the time. Share market—daily; IPL—yearly. I find each of the cricket matches, no matter if they are Test, ODI, or T20, generates so much data. I tried once with the ODI World Cup; it&amp;rsquo;s not at all a good one. It&amp;rsquo;s been a couple of years, and I&amp;rsquo;m planning to visualize this IPL. My preferred tool is D3JS, and even with that, I&amp;rsquo;m limited to a few shapes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Analog Clock</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/07/analog-clock/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/07/analog-clock/</guid><description>&lt;p>First we started with a circle. The dial is composed of a bigger circle and a smaller one - a center point.&lt;/p>
&lt;body>
 &lt;div class="one">&lt;/div>
 &lt;script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js">&lt;/script>
 &lt;script src="./1.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;/body>
&lt;p>With the dial is in place, next step is to add arms of the clock. The end result should have 3 arms - depicting hours, minutes and seconds. To have quicker feedback we started with seconds arm.&lt;/p>
&lt;body>
 &lt;div class="two">&lt;/div>
 &lt;script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js">&lt;/script>
 &lt;script src="./2.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;/body>
&lt;p>Drawing the radius solves the initial position of seconds arm. However, to have the arm goes around the clock, we need to calculate &lt;code>(x,y)&lt;/code> coordinates.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Visualization: Post grouped by years - D3 - v3</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/06/visualization-post-grouped-by-years-d3-v3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/06/visualization-post-grouped-by-years-d3-v3/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a follow up to last month&amp;rsquo;s post on &lt;a href="../post-062-visual-site-map-1/">same name&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="whats-new">What&amp;rsquo;s new?&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Tooltip - Earlier, we were employing the browser&amp;rsquo;s native tooltip. With this update we have customised tooltip with publish date and categories along with the title of post.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Transitions - On hovering the circles turns green and tooltip pops up.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
 &lt;style>
 .tooltip {
 position: absolute;
 font-family: monospace;
 pointer-events: none;
 background: silver;
 color: black;
 /* width: 400px; */
 text-align: left;
 border-radius: 6px;
 padding: 5px 5px;
 left: 50%;
 margin-left: -60px;
 z-index: 1;
 }

 .tooltip::after {
 content: "";
 position: relative;
 top: 100%;
 /* left: 0; */
 margin-left: -5px;
 border-width: 8px;
 border-style: solid;
 border-color: transparent transparent transparent transparent;

&lt;p>There are few changes made to the chart.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Today marker: Instead of drawing a full line for the current year, we are allowing the line to grow with passing day. This is a major change.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Transition: The trasnition effects are the major change here. Ironically, the amount of code change is minimum - tbh addition of 2 lines is all that&amp;rsquo;s needed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hyperlinks: All the hyperlinks are made colored with dark blue, as this is the &lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links_colors.asp#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20a%20link%20will,link%20is%20underlined%20and%20red">default color&lt;/a> in all browsers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tooltip: We have used &lt;code>title&lt;/code> tag to implement the tooltip. This is not a major change or in other words the tooltip can be better. For that we have to go for CSS method, which is still a bit far from my reach.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;body>
 &lt;div class="canvas">&lt;/div>
 &lt;script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js">&lt;/script>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m more of backend developer, working predominantly in Python + SQL. But, trying out JS is long time wish, which got fufilled through a Udemy course and some good imspiration.&lt;/p>
&lt;body>
 &lt;div class="canvas">&lt;/div>
 &lt;script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js">&lt;/script>
 &lt;script src="index.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;/body>
&lt;p>The visuals can be improved vastly and can add few more options. But this post is to show the progress.
Also, this is an attempt to conform that D3JS output can be hosted on our static site.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Visualization: Post grouped by years</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/04/visualization-post-grouped-by-years/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Apr 2023 12:22:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/04/visualization-post-grouped-by-years/</guid><description>&lt;p>Once in a while we stumble into something interesting while we are not looking for it. This is a post on how I came across a chart while going through an online course, the experience in replicating the chart, the lessons I learnt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The instructor of the course - &lt;a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/datavizcourse">Course: Data Visualization Fundamentals and Best Practices&lt;/a> by ObservableHQ. While going through his website I found this interesting chart - &lt;a href="https://eagereyes.org/blog-calendar">Blog Calendar&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- What is the inspiration -->
&lt;h3 id="the-discovery">The discovery&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Displaying his blog posts over the years in a chart was something I&amp;rsquo;m seeing for the first time. Since then even during his class I was seeing it how it was built and imagining how it would look for my blog. During the time provide for the final assignment, I doubled down and spent time on exploring tools to recreate the chart.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
