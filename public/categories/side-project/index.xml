      <description>While browsing through Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s sub in Reddit, I came across Pi-hole.
Pi-hole is an interesting project, claims to be black hole of Ads. I guess the pi in the name refers to Raspberry Pi. As my Pi3 was lying in the corner unused, I went for the Pi-hole installation. Before continuing further on the experience, we need to discuss why the ads are bothering?
What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with ads? I agree the ads are the revenue source of websites.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working in a corporate firm which employs 100K+ employees. As do with any organization of such a magnitude, there are certain rules &amp;amp; policies which cannot be breached. In most of the occasions, the policies really help us navigate without much of the issue. Yet, there are situations which impedes our progress.
The impedement I felt was merging PDF files. What&amp;rsquo;s there to worry about, you may wonder. In our org, we have some version of Adobe Reader to view PDFs.</description>
