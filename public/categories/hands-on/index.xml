      <description>Some reference on how to connect to a Raspberry Pi running in the same LAN network.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Raspberry Pi running in home, for last 10 months. Until a month ago, the sole purpose of the RPi is to filter off the ads using Pi-hole1, then a speed test module was scheduled to run on it. By the setup, the speedtest-cli runs every 10 mins and fetches internet into csv file.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with Big data since 2017. As I&amp;rsquo;m from data warehousing background, it was easier for me to understand what&amp;rsquo;s what, and build an analogy between DWH &amp;amp; big data frameworks. However, the various file formats used in HDFS always caught me off guard.
In DWH, I never considered how the files are stored in DB, it&amp;rsquo;s managed by the database, maybe DBA might know how its done at the backend, as a DB developer it never bothered me.</description>
