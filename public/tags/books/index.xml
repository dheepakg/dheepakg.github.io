      <description>This is about The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel, a Columnist. This book became a sensation in the #fintwit. Many tweeters recommended the book and I preordered it on Amazon.
   {:height=&amp;ldquo;600px&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;450px&amp;rdquo;}     Book Cover    The book is crisp - 240 pages grouped into 20 chapters, each having few stories to explain actions behind money decisions.
Notes from each of the chapter Introduction  A genius who loses control of their emotions can be a financial disaster.</description>

      <description>My SO asked a curious question. I froze, like a Windows XP machine, couldn&amp;rsquo;t answer then. After the incident, for several nights, the question ran through in my head to decipher the answer.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with little about me . I like to read books. As of today, reading is one of the hobby for me. For her, reading is a boring chore, like majority around me.
The question was simple and on to the point.</description>
