I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Raspberry Pi running in home, for last 10 months. Until a month ago, the sole purpose of the RPi is to filter off the ads using Pi-hole1, then a speed test module was scheduled to run on it. By the setup, the speedtest-cli runs every 10 mins and fetches internet into csv file.</description></item><item><title>No more Ad breaks - thanks Pi-hole</title><link>/post/2019-06-17-no-more-ad-breaks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2019 20:12:27 +0530</pubDate><guid>/post/2019-06-17-no-more-ad-breaks/</guid><description>While browsing through Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s sub in Reddit, I came across Pi-hole.
Pi-hole is an interesting project, claims to be black hole of Ads. I guess the pi in the name refers to Raspberry Pi. As my Pi3 was lying in the corner unused, I went for the Pi-hole installation. Before continuing further on the experience, we need to discuss why the ads are bothering?
What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with ads? I agree the ads are the revenue source of websites.</description></item></channel></rss>
