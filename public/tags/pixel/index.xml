      <description>The relationship lasted for 2 years, 3 months, 11 days. Barring restroom moments, we were together all the time. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about my Pixel 2, which has provided me a wonderful experience on any electronics gadget that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever owned.
There are few things, worth mentioning here, both positive &amp;amp; negative.
Software-hardware, made for each other - Even though I haven&amp;rsquo;t used any flagship mobile till then, I feel P2 showed me how it feels when OS is made for hardware.</description>
