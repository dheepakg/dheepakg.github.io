These were comes with different levels of restrictions. Among them is suspension of non-essential goods sales over e-commerce. This doesn&rsquo;t look bad in first look, but devil is in the details.
What were labelled as essentials? The baby care items and grocery items. What about the office essentials? They were labelled as non-essentials. What&rsquo;s wrong with it, not everyone needs the office supplies, so its not an essential component.

Not all the homes are equipped to support a work environment. There was huge need from power supply extension to faulty laptop components which were available in e-Commerce site for a cheaper price than a store. Also, with the lockdown rules being imposed, stepping into a store and searching for a replacement accessories was not at all practical.
