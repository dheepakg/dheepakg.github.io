Each of the episodes deals with events in cyberspace.
My favourite episode is the one that covered the Bangladesh Bank Heist.
There is no coding involved, Jack explains the strange/new words in layman terms. You should give a try if you&amp;rsquo;re curious about what&amp;rsquo;s happening in cyber space.
PS: Darknet Diaries has no relation with the darknet, the one accessed through Tor.</description></item><item><title>Talk Python To Me</title><link>/recommended/2020-12-30-talk-py-to-me/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2020 22:07:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>/recommended/2020-12-30-talk-py-to-me/</guid><description>This is the 1stever podcast that I started with.
