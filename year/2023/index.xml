&lt;p>I always wonder if uncertainty is bad, possibly the worst feature of life, or may be a bug in life. But uncertainty is not something new that we tend to experience recently. Since the earliest times, uncertainty has been part of life. Thinking out loud, waking up next morning is as uncertain as the weather.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Earth has gone through several extinctions before taking its current form. According to the experts, it has gone through the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event">Big Five Mass Extinction&lt;/a>.
Apart from these extinction events, we understand now that many species go kaput every day. We could be the ones on any day, and the day hasn&amp;rsquo;t arrived yet. Recently, a microbe has shown us how brittle we are.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Experience with raising PR</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/11/experience-with-raising-pr/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/11/experience-with-raising-pr/</guid><description>&lt;p>This post deals with my experience on contributing to the open source project - Microsoft Documentation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Last week, my kid fell ill. It was a viral fever with cold. Due to the intense cold, she was struggling to breathe and had ear pain. We were constantly clearing up the nasal passage and helping her with breathing. However, she was helpless with ear pain. As per the pediatrician&amp;rsquo;s instructions, we gave her a tonic to relieve her ear pain. The medicine is not a magic potion to heal instantaneously; it was slow process. Her body takes time to act on it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The way a child learns</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/07/the-way-a-child-learns/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/07/the-way-a-child-learns/</guid><description>&lt;p>Of late I&amp;rsquo;m spending good amount of time with my toddler. The things she learns and the way she communicates is intriguing me. To be frank, I believe almost every kid does the same, more or less. But as I am seeing her development from very close I do observe on how she learns.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- 1. Imitatates what an elder does. repeating -->
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Imitation&lt;/strong>: She imitates us. Whatever we do she tries to replicate us. For example, she tries to saute the imaginary food on her toy kitchen set.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;!-- 2. Does learn from everyone, adult, elder sibling, animals, birds. No ego. -->
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>No Ego&lt;/strong>: They doesn&amp;rsquo;t decide on whom to copy from. She mimics what her cousin does. The cousin we are talking about is barely an year old. She sees something new, she copis it; no discrimination on age.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;!-- 3. Questions without thinking what others will think -->
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Not thinking what others thinking&lt;/strong>: She doesn&amp;rsquo;t consider what others thinking. Isn&amp;rsquo;t it this factor stops us from doing what we love. Having said that, sometimes she screams in public place irritating fellow beings.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;!-- 4. Pattern matching. Kinnam vs kannam -->
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Identifying patterns&lt;/strong>: Numbers are abstract concept for a toddler. Yet, on saying 3, she runs. Its more like a pattern matching than understanding 1-2-3.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;!-- 5. Observing all the time -->
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Observing all the time&lt;/strong>: There is no dedicated learning time for her. She just goes on to observer and mimic all the time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fumbling 145 days long kindle reading streak</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/06/fumbling-145-days-long-kindle-reading-streak/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/06/fumbling-145-days-long-kindle-reading-streak/</guid><description>&lt;p>If my memory serves right, Snapchat popularised the &lt;em>streak&lt;/em> phenomena.

&lt;li>Tooltip - Earlier, we were employing the browser&amp;rsquo;s native tooltip. With this update we have customised tooltip with publish date and categories along with the title of post.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>There are few changes made to the chart.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Today marker: Instead of drawing a full line for the current year, we are allowing the line to grow with passing day. This is a major change.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Transition: The trasnition effects are the major change here. Ironically, the amount of code change is minimum - tbh addition of 2 lines is all that&amp;rsquo;s needed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hyperlinks: All the hyperlinks are made colored with dark blue, as this is the &lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links_colors.asp#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20a%20link%20will,link%20is%20underlined%20and%20red">default color&lt;/a> in all browsers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tooltip: We have used &lt;code>title&lt;/code> tag to implement the tooltip. This is not a major change or in other words the tooltip can be better. For that we have to go for CSS method, which is still a bit far from my reach.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>The visuals can be improved vastly and can add few more options. But this post is to show the progress.

&lt;p>For example, the working components are modularised for easier maintenance. These individual modules are built on TDD approach, testing with every step of our development. The test results are passed through coverage to understand how much code is covered under our testing process. And, based on this coverage status the code is committed into Git repo. This regulates clean and working code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Personal help/maid affordability - a social indicator?</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/01/personal-help/maid-affordability-a-social-indicator/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 12:22:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/01/personal-help/maid-affordability-a-social-indicator/</guid><description>&lt;!-- Spreading rumour/stealing are not a big issue. -->
