&lt;p>I was using Hugo for static site generation with Beautiful Hugo as a theme. The theme is known for its balancing act between simplicity and proseness for a blog. With Hugo its a fast act to creating and publishing the contents.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- What are we missing? -->
&lt;p>It was all good until I wanted to embed a HTML page. iFrame is always there but including the charts, especially interactive ones generated as HTML is tough to embed in the post (at least for me). I do feel interactive charts are better than the static charts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What if: Google suspends your account?</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2022/08/what-if-google-suspends-your-account/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 09:30:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2022/08/what-if-google-suspends-your-account/</guid><description>&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;re waking up to your alarm. On turning the alarm off you notice there is some error notification, but you casually swipe it away to get started on the day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While you&amp;rsquo;re commuting to your office you notice the Whatsapp backup ran into some error, now you &lt;em>ignore&lt;/em> it as it&amp;rsquo;s not something important. During your tea-break in office you are opening Google Photos to look at your child&amp;rsquo;s memories. Just like earlier notifications Googl Photos too throw some error at you, now you can&amp;rsquo;t able to download the backed-up photos.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hugo Site Deployment Using Github Actions</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2022/05/hugo-site-deployment-using-github-actions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 May 2022 19:50:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2022/05/hugo-site-deployment-using-github-actions/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a small write up about setting up GitHub Actions to deploy Hugo site.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="how-i-was-deploying-it-earlier">How I was deploying it earlier?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I used to have 2 commits for any changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Changes to the posts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>HTML documents generated through &lt;code>hugo&lt;/code> command&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="what-was-the-problem-there">What was the problem there?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The major problem is the process involves 2 steps. Sometimes, I used to forget generating HTML docs and the changes never flow into the static site.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cross compatibility is key</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2022/05/cross-compatibility-is-key/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 08:50:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2022/05/cross-compatibility-is-key/</guid><description>&lt;p>When my kid was on a mattress, she was hesitant to move around. Later on, with the comfort of the soft surface, she was rolling around without caring about her head getting hurt or gravity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everything got changed when we let her crawl on the hard surface in the living room. She was getting hurt quite frequently - sometimes stepping on a toy, or hard landing on her head while rolling on the floor, or simply butting on something at her head level. Slowly, she got learned to avoid those hurting her. These days she evaluates the surfaces before taking another step.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
