The theme is known for its balancing act between simplicity and proseness for a blog. With Hugo its a fast act to creating and publishing the contents.
It was all good until I wanted to embed a HTML page. iFrame is always there but including the charts, especially interactive ones generated as HTML is tough to embed in the post (at least for me).</description></item><item><title>What if: Google suspends your account?</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2022/08/what-if-google-suspends-your-account/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 09:30:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2022/08/what-if-google-suspends-your-account/</guid><description>You&amp;rsquo;re waking up to your alarm.

While you&amp;rsquo;re commuting to your office you notice the Whatsapp backup ran into some error, now you ignore it as it&amp;rsquo;s not something important. During your tea-break in office you are opening Google Photos to look at your child&amp;rsquo;s memories.

Later on, with the comfort of the soft surface, she was rolling around without caring about her head getting hurt or gravity.
Everything got changed when we let her crawl on the hard surface in the living room. She was getting hurt quite frequently - sometimes stepping on a toy, or hard landing on her head while rolling on the floor, or simply butting on something at her head level.</description></item></channel></rss>
