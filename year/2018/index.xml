Interpreting it could be final frontier for AI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Understanding Sarcastic line is a complex process. Depends on lots of variables — context, body language, tone modulation and so on. To be fair there is not proper/scientific way to decode sarcasm. To add to it, degree of closeness is (kinda) proportional to complexity of sarcasm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In one of the scene Deadpool 2 movie, the lead actor was questioned who he is. Responding, he says, “I’m Batman”. The whole theater erupts in laughter. You can understand this if you’re aware of Batman and his punchlines.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What is farming — Biz or Charity?</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2018/02/what-is-farming-biz-or-charity/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Feb 2018 21:47:17 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2018/02/what-is-farming-biz-or-charity/</guid><description>&lt;p>Occupation (for-profit) or welfare/charity (non-profit)?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the question which started a long conversation with my friend over Whatsapp.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why does it matter? Everything depends on the answer. If it’s Occupation, you can tax them for the revenue, likewise you can insure them so they can land safe in times of tragedy. Or if its a welfare, government can take it or some NGOs can chip in with funding from benevolent sponsors.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
