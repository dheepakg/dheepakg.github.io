&lt;p>Joe Biden (aka &lt;a href="https://railway-news.com/how-did-president-elect-biden-get-the-nickname-amtrak-joe/">Amtrak Joe&lt;/a>) is the president-elect, winning over the incumbent Donald J Trump. It&amp;rsquo;s been a huge drama right from the preparation to election till the vote counting. And, even now the counting is not over - &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2020/nov/09/senate-and-house-elections-2020-full-results-for-congress">the Senate &amp;amp; the House results are awaited&lt;/a>.

However, the various file formats used in HDFS always caught me off guard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In DWH, I never considered how the files are stored in DB, it&amp;rsquo;s managed by the database, maybe DBA might know how its done at the backend, as a DB developer it never bothered me. However, in HDFS we have several types of formats to choose from - &lt;em>Avro, ORC &amp;amp; Parquet.&lt;/em> The best way to understand something is to spend time with it.

More-or-less this was a typical arrangement of our residence. Green-thingy was the mosquito net, without which you can&amp;rsquo;t protect your blood. Addition to ceiling fan, we had 2 table fans. Even thats not enough for the Chennai summer. And so, we used up the another option. Check out next photo.&lt;/h5>

I was in the middle of under graduate course when the decade begun. An average engineering graduate who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what engineering really was or what&amp;rsquo;s the future is offering. The end of year marks the recruitment to my current employer. Yes right, I&amp;rsquo;m with the employer for almost a decade.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IIRC 13k was my 1&lt;sup>st&lt;/sup> my first salary. Couldn&amp;rsquo;t recall how I spent it, guess gave it to my mom. My first smartphone was Galaxy Ace with 142 MB of memory (now there are plenty of apps that comes with larger memory footprint than the phone).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
