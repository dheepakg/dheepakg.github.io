&lt;p>For those unfamiliar, Aadhaar is a universal identity card (or &lt;a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/government-makes-citizenship-disclaimer-on-new-aadhaar-cards-more-prominent/article67780076.ece">not&lt;/a>). It is a biometric-based 12-digit unique number, more or less covers the entire Indian population.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aadhaar translates to &lt;em>foundation&lt;/em> or &lt;em>root&lt;/em>. The Aadhaar number is essential for maintaining access to a bank account or a Demat account, mobile connection, and more. The number follows you like a shadow till death. Heck, the number won&amp;rsquo;t even leave you after death. You would need it at &lt;a href="https://kaashimukthi.com/what-documents-are-required-for-cremation-in-india/">cremation center&lt;/a>, then for the death certificate and for transferring your estate as well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The way a child learns</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/07/the-way-a-child-learns/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/07/the-way-a-child-learns/</guid><description>&lt;p>Of late I&amp;rsquo;m spending good amount of time with my toddler. The things she learns and the way she communicates is intriguing me. To be frank, I believe almost every kid does the same, more or less. But as I am seeing her development from very close I do observe on how she learns.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- 1. Imitatates what an elder does. repeating -->
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Imitation&lt;/strong>: She imitates us. Whatever we do she tries to replicate us. For example, she tries to saute the imaginary food on her toy kitchen set.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;!-- 2. Does learn from everyone, adult, elder sibling, animals, birds. No ego. -->
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>No Ego&lt;/strong>: They doesn&amp;rsquo;t decide on whom to copy from. She mimics what her cousin does. The cousin we are talking about is barely an year old. She sees something new, she copis it; no discrimination on age.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;!-- 3. Questions without thinking what others will think -->
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Not thinking what others thinking&lt;/strong>: She doesn&amp;rsquo;t consider what others thinking. Isn&amp;rsquo;t it this factor stops us from doing what we love. Having said that, sometimes she screams in public place irritating fellow beings.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;!-- 4. Pattern matching. Kinnam vs kannam -->
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Identifying patterns&lt;/strong>: Numbers are abstract concept for a toddler. Yet, on saying 3, she runs. Its more like a pattern matching than understanding 1-2-3.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;!-- 5. Observing all the time -->
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Observing all the time&lt;/strong>: There is no dedicated learning time for her. She just goes on to observer and mimic all the time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A backend dev's journey into JS world - Part I</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2021/08/a-backend-devs-journey-into-js-world-part-i/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 13:26:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2021/08/a-backend-devs-journey-into-js-world-part-i/</guid><description>&lt;p>I use SQL and Python to earn my bread. Being an ETL developer turned Data Engineer, my work is to fetch data from different sources, cleaning it, and making it consumption ready before storing it in some storage space - database, S3 et al.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s amusing to know that someone will be consuming this data and pull insights from it like a magician pulling a rabbit off his hat. The reporting tools were the go-to place to churn these processed data. The decision-makers use the reports generated by these tools. The reports are mostly limited to tables, bar, line, or pie charts.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
