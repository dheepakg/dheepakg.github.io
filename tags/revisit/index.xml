This post is about looking back at the past year through various criteria,&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Personal life&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Career&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hobby&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Finance&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="personal-life">Personal Life&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Work-life balance oculd have been better, its not like the employer is squeezing me. But its my ability to give priority to the family. If at all one thing I need to work on this year, that would be more time spent with family and cultivating memories.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
