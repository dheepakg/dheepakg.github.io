&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Raspberry Pi running in home, for last 10 months. Until a month ago, the sole purpose of the RPi is to &lt;a href="https://dheepakg.github.io/diy/2019/06/17/no-more-ad-breaks.html">filter off the ads&lt;/a> using Pi-hole&lt;sup id="a1">&lt;a href="#f1">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, then a speed test module was scheduled to run on it. By the setup, the speedtest-cli runs every 10 mins and fetches internet into csv file. the plan is to arrive to some meaningful conclusion of the data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>No more Ad breaks - thanks Pi-hole</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2019/06/no-more-ad-breaks-thanks-pi-hole/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2019 20:12:27 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2019/06/no-more-ad-breaks-thanks-pi-hole/</guid><description>&lt;p>While browsing through Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s sub in Reddit, I came across &lt;a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-hole&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pi-hole is an interesting project, claims to be black hole of Ads. I guess the &lt;em>pi&lt;/em> in the name refers to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">Raspberry Pi&lt;/a>. As my Pi3 was lying in the corner unused, I went for the Pi-hole installation. Before continuing further on the experience, we need to discuss why the ads are bothering?&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="whats-wrong-with-ads">What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with ads?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I agree the ads are the revenue source of websites. They are good as long as they don&amp;rsquo;t obstruct the usage, but do they? If not, we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have went for browser level Ad blockers in first place. Having an Ad blocker in browser works good. But, this may impact performance of the browser. There are &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-chrome-ad-blockers-extensions-api/">news that claims&lt;/a> Google may break the working of Ad blockers in Chrome. The situation of smartphones are mush worse. Especially, in Android. There are no regulation, even in the popular apps, the Ads are placed in every available real estate. The expectation is to hijack your attention when you accidentally touch these spaces. There are apps which can protect you from ads, you&amp;rsquo;ve to sideload them, but sideloading an app is not a safe option.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
