&lt;p>This is the question which started a long conversation with my friend over Whatsapp.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why does it matter? Everything depends on the answer. If it’s Occupation, you can tax them for the revenue, likewise you can insure them so they can land safe in times of tragedy. Or if its a welfare, government can take it or some NGOs can chip in with funding from benevolent sponsors.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
