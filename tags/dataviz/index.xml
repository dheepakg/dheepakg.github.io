The graphics published in sites like FT, Reuters, or NYT made me wonder why I don&amp;rsquo;t spend time on the skill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The good volume and variety of data that is available is available all the time. Share market—daily; IPL—yearly. I find each of the cricket matches, no matter if they are Test, ODI, or T20, generates so much data. I tried once with the ODI World Cup; it&amp;rsquo;s not at all a good one. It&amp;rsquo;s been a couple of years, and I&amp;rsquo;m planning to visualize this IPL. My preferred tool is D3JS, and even with that, I&amp;rsquo;m limited to a few shapes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Index Movement - Visualization</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/01/index-movement-visualization/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/01/index-movement-visualization/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="why">Why?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To keep myself from overthinking or having negative thoughts, I should focus my energy on something creative. Also, the creativity should pique my curiosity. Essentially, I should spend time learning something. Personal finance is something that we monitor and learn about in a daily manner. The PF has a variety of numbers and data to deal with. It&amp;rsquo;s more like clay that allows you to come up with any sculpture.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Data Visualization</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/11/why-data-visualization/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/11/why-data-visualization/</guid><description>&lt;p>Why I chose to pursue a journey in Data Visualization? This post is an explainer to the above question.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="what-do-i-do-for-living">What do I do for living?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Data Engineering is my day job. SQL and Python have fed me and kept me going for last decade. For the uninitiated, the work involves fetching data from several sources and loading into desired target. The &lt;em>source&lt;/em> and &lt;em>target&lt;/em> could be a database, API endpoint, or file.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Visualization: Post grouped by years - D3 - v3</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/06/visualization-post-grouped-by-years-d3-v3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/06/visualization-post-grouped-by-years-d3-v3/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a follow up to last month&amp;rsquo;s post on &lt;a href="../post-062-visual-site-map-1/">same name&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="whats-new">What&amp;rsquo;s new?&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Tooltip - Earlier, we were employing the browser&amp;rsquo;s native tooltip. With this update we have customised tooltip with publish date and categories along with the title of post.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Transitions - On hovering the circles turns green and tooltip pops up.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
 &lt;style>
 .tooltip {
 position: absolute;
 font-family: monospace;
 pointer-events: none;
 background: silver;
 color: black;
 /* width: 400px; */
 text-align: left;
 border-radius: 6px;
 padding: 5px 5px;
 left: 50%;
 margin-left: -60px;
 z-index: 1;
 }

 .tooltip::after {
 content: "";
 position: relative;
 top: 100%;
 /* left: 0; */
 margin-left: -5px;
 border-width: 8px;
 border-style: solid;
 border-color: transparent transparent transparent transparent;
 }
 &lt;/style>

&lt;p>There are few changes made to the chart.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Today marker: Instead of drawing a full line for the current year, we are allowing the line to grow with passing day. This is a major change.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Transition: The trasnition effects are the major change here. Ironically, the amount of code change is minimum - tbh addition of 2 lines is all that&amp;rsquo;s needed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hyperlinks: All the hyperlinks are made colored with dark blue, as this is the &lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links_colors.asp#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20a%20link%20will,link%20is%20underlined%20and%20red">default color&lt;/a> in all browsers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tooltip: We have used &lt;code>title&lt;/code> tag to implement the tooltip. This is not a major change or in other words the tooltip can be better. For that we have to go for CSS method, which is still a bit far from my reach.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;body>
 &lt;div class="canvas">&lt;/div>
 &lt;script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js">&lt;/script>
 &lt;script src="index.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;/body>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m more of backend developer, working predominantly in Python + SQL. But, trying out JS is long time wish, which got fufilled through a Udemy course and some good imspiration.&lt;/p>
&lt;body>
 &lt;div class="canvas">&lt;/div>
 &lt;script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js">&lt;/script>
 &lt;script src="index.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;/body>
&lt;p>The visuals can be improved vastly and can add few more options. But this post is to show the progress.
Also, this is an attempt to conform that D3JS output can be hosted on our static site.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Visualization: Post grouped by years</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/04/visualization-post-grouped-by-years/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Apr 2023 12:22:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/04/visualization-post-grouped-by-years/</guid><description>&lt;p>Once in a while we stumble into something interesting while we are not looking for it. This is a post on how I came across a chart while going through an online course, the experience in replicating the chart, the lessons I learnt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The instructor of the course - &lt;a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/datavizcourse">Course: Data Visualization Fundamentals and Best Practices&lt;/a> by ObservableHQ. While going through his website I found this interesting chart - &lt;a href="https://eagereyes.org/blog-calendar">Blog Calendar&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- What is the inspiration -->
&lt;h3 id="the-discovery">The discovery&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Displaying his blog posts over the years in a chart was something I&amp;rsquo;m seeing for the first time. Since then even during his class I was seeing it how it was built and imagining how it would look for my blog. During the time provide for the final assignment, I doubled down and spent time on exploring tools to recreate the chart.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How much Income Tax Are We Paying?</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2022/05/how-much-income-tax-are-we-paying/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2022 08:30:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2022/05/how-much-income-tax-are-we-paying/</guid><description>&lt;script src="https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2022/05/how-much-income-tax-are-we-paying/index_files/htmlwidgets/htmlwidgets.js">&lt;/script>

&lt;p>During the last months of every financial year, there is a tradition, a custom to keep ourselves sane - ranting on tax that we suffered through the year, and any returns we can expect from the taxmen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In one of the ranting sessions, we had an interesting conversation.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>How much tax are we paying?&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>What is so interesting?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The tax must be &lt;a href="https://cleartax.in/s/income-tax-slabs">either 25% (new regime) or 30% (old regime)&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A backend dev's journey into JS world - Part I</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2021/08/a-backend-devs-journey-into-js-world-part-i/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 13:26:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2021/08/a-backend-devs-journey-into-js-world-part-i/</guid><description>&lt;p>I use SQL and Python to earn my bread. Being an ETL developer turned Data Engineer, my work is to fetch data from different sources, cleaning it, and making it consumption ready before storing it in some storage space - database, S3 et al.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s amusing to know that someone will be consuming this data and pull insights from it like a magician pulling a rabbit off his hat. The reporting tools were the go-to place to churn these processed data. The decision-makers use the reports generated by these tools. The reports are mostly limited to tables, bar, line, or pie charts.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
