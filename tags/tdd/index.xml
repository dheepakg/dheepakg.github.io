Instead of building a spaghetti code that just works, we are approaching the entire process through the industry practise.
For example, the working components are modularised for easier maintenance. These individual modules are built on TDD approach, testing with every step of our development. The test results are passed through coverage to understand how much code is covered under our testing process.</description></item></channel></rss>
