This is a post on how I came across a chart while going through an online course, the experience in replicating the chart, the lessons I learnt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The instructor of the course - &lt;a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/datavizcourse">Course: Data Visualization Fundamentals and Best Practices&lt;/a> by ObservableHQ. While going through his website I found this interesting chart - &lt;a href="https://eagereyes.org/blog-calendar">Blog Calendar&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- What is the inspiration -->
&lt;h3 id="the-discovery">The discovery&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Displaying his blog posts over the years in a chart was something I&amp;rsquo;m seeing for the first time. Since then even during his class I was seeing it how it was built and imagining how it would look for my blog. During the time provide for the final assignment, I doubled down and spent time on exploring tools to recreate the chart.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
