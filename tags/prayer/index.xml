Meaning I don&amp;rsquo;t strictly follow the religious activities, I do constantly question the practises. I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether I&amp;rsquo;m an atheist or an agnostic. But I do believe there could be some powerful entity. Could be a god, family of gods or nature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I was living abroad for the work purpose, I need a social interaction. That made me to visit temple every week, almost. I do consider myself a rational person, so the conventional prayers like asking the God to give this or that made no sense. After all it is an all knowing entity. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t it knows what should be given to me?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
