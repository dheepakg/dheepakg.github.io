There are few changes made to the chart.
Today marker: Instead of drawing a full line for the current year, we are allowing the line to grow with passing day. This is a major change. Transition: The trasnition effects are the major change here. Ironically, the amount of code change is minimum - tbh addition of 2 lines is all that&amp;rsquo;s needed.</description></item><item><title>Visualization: Post grouped by years - D3</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/04/visualization-post-grouped-by-years-d3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2023 12:22:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/04/visualization-post-grouped-by-years-d3/</guid><description>This is an attempt to recreate the earlier created blog post through D3js.
I&amp;rsquo;m more of backend developer, working predominantly in Python + SQL. But, trying out JS is long time wish, which got fufilled through a Udemy course and some good imspiration.
The visuals can be improved vastly and can add few more options. But this post is to show the progress. Also, this is an attempt to conform that D3JS output can be hosted on our static site.</description></item></channel></rss>
