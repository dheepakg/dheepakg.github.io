&lt;p>I started following the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@muthaleetukalam">channel&lt;/a> during the lockdown, just like million other self-proclaimed investors. The channel is not for trader/speculator/FnO players or gamblers. The videos pops up everyday since the lockdown times. The primary theme is investor behavior, or current events with respect of finance or economics. Some day special guests gets featured, to share their experience.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Investing in real estates</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/05/investing-in-real-estates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/05/investing-in-real-estates/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a write up on my thoughts abour real estate as investment.

&lt;p>This is entirely unregulated space. Meaning, there is no check and balance to help the consumers. With no regulations, the black money is very very common. As the transaction is under the regulator&amp;rsquo;s radar, there is no place to approach for any type of grievances.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
