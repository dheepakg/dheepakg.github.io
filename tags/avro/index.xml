As I&amp;rsquo;m from data warehousing background, it was easier for me to understand what&amp;rsquo;s what, and build an analogy between DWH &amp;amp; big data frameworks. However, the various file formats used in HDFS always caught me off guard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In DWH, I never considered how the files are stored in DB, it&amp;rsquo;s managed by the database, maybe DBA might know how its done at the backend, as a DB developer it never bothered me. However, in HDFS we have several types of formats to choose from - &lt;em>Avro, ORC &amp;amp; Parquet.&lt;/em> The best way to understand something is to spend time with it. So, decided to see how the different files behave for same data.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
