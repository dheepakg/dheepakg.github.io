&lt;h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m part of Data landscape for more than a decade now. I started as ETL developer, then evolved into Data Engineer. When I was crawling the ETL world, the Data Scientists were already declared as the &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century">sexiest job&lt;/a>, and Big Data was a novelty. The 1st time I heard about the power of the data and analytics was from the famous &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/">Forbes article on Target&lt;/a>. I was awestruck. Then later on I started working on Big Data with AWS, as a Data Engineer.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
