My first PR This is not my first PR to an OSS. My very first contribution was to foambubble/foam. The pull request adds licence file to the repo. Yea, I know. This may not qualifies for core technical task. Nevertheless its my contribution. This lead to my Github badge - Pull Shark.
I started interacting with the developers on the fix on April 14th 2021.</description></item></channel></rss>
