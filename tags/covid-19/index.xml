It&amp;rsquo;s been a huge drama right from the preparation to election till the vote counting.

Even now the President is not conceding defeat.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Essentially, they're non-essentials</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2020/06/essentially-theyre-non-essentials/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jun 2020 19:24:27 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2020/06/essentially-theyre-non-essentials/</guid><description>&lt;p>The future generations must be viewing &lt;em>this&lt;/em> as a biggest psychological experiment, worst case scenario and the inhumane practice to save humanity and much more. &lt;em>This&lt;/em> is COVID-19 &lt;strong>lockdown&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lockdown was imposed on March 25&lt;sup>th&lt;/sup> 2020. Being a social animal, we went through a lot. The ill effects of lockdown ranges from anxiety induced due to potential job loss - &lt;a href="https://www.thehindu.com/business/indias-unemployment-rate-rises-to-2711-amid-covid-19-crisis-cmie/article31511006.ece">historic unemployment rate&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/22/news/economy/1980s-millennials-great-recession-study/index.html">potential downturn of investments&lt;/a> in coming years, struggling to keep up with daily work-from-home with &lt;a href="https://theprint.in/opinion/pov/not-a-win-win-situation-why-we-should-not-work-from-home-after-the-covid-19-lockdown/397284/">it&amp;rsquo;s own challenges&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
