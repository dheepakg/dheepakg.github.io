Went to war, in cyber world, with my friends whenever they say Saudi Arabia/China style of government is better than D-government. I’m pro-democracy because I believe in free will of humans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far, every dictator has ruled the people, crushed the basic rights in the name of religion, communism, socialism et al. We are not animals to be herded by some dictator. On the other end of spectrum, we have democracy. Governments &amp;amp; leaders selected by the people, for the people. Theoretically, we will be having a better leader under Democracy.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
