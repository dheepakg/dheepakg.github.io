&lt;p>Everyone of us think(or worry) about future, especially in 30s. Likewise, I worry about financial stability of my future. The retirement comes top of the list among the various worries. And so, I started investement. The investment includes various vahicles - Mutual fund, stocks and fixed components. Investing is a beast; tracking the investment is like taming the beast. For tracking the progress there are (literally) endless apps coming into to market. You must either trade in your data or pay for some freemium features.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First serious project that has some rational application</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2019/05/first-serious-project-that-has-some-rational-application/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 May 2019 23:15:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2019/05/first-serious-project-that-has-some-rational-application/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m working in a corporate firm which employs 100K+ employees.

&lt;p>The impedement I felt was merging PDF files. What&amp;rsquo;s there to worry about, you may wonder. In our org, we have some version of Adobe Reader to view PDFs. Eventhough I&amp;rsquo;m not a big fan of Adobe, there are no alternatives in &lt;a href="https://alternativeto.net/software/adobe-reader/">my workplace&lt;/a> that I know of, at least. The version of Reader I&amp;rsquo;m allowed to use doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow me to Merge PDFs. Ironically, it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to merge the files while submitting the PDFs for various official purpose.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
