The usual trip between the cities is on long weekends, so does the large crowd settled in &lt;em>Singara&lt;/em> Chennai. With a huge crowd looking to travel back on long weekends, reserving a seat was not easiest thing to do. I booked my ticket a week back and in relaxed manner went to boarding point. While checking the ticket I noticed the booking was for previous day. There was no way to travel back on that day.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
