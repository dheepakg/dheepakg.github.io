&lt;h2 id="how-i-was-deploying-it-earlier">How I was deploying it earlier?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I used to have 2 commits for any changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Changes to the posts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>HTML documents generated through &lt;code>hugo&lt;/code> command&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="what-was-the-problem-there">What was the problem there?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The major problem is the process involves 2 steps. Sometimes, I used to forget generating HTML docs and the changes never flow into the static site.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cross compatibility is key</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2022/05/cross-compatibility-is-key/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2022 08:50:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2022/05/cross-compatibility-is-key/</guid><description>&lt;p>When my kid was on a mattress, she was hesitant to move around. Later on, with the comfort of the soft surface, she was rolling around without caring about her head getting hurt or gravity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everything got changed when we let her crawl on the hard surface in the living room. She was getting hurt quite frequently - sometimes stepping on a toy, or hard landing on her head while rolling on the floor, or simply butting on something at her head level. Slowly, she got learned to avoid those hurting her. These days she evaluates the surfaces before taking another step.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
