In 2018, I came to know about Pycon taking place in Cleveland, OH. Dan Bader&amp;rsquo;s vlog on PyCon &amp;lsquo;18 was another pull factor towards the PyCon. Due to the ticket pricing I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it to it. In H2 of 2018, I returned to India, and was looking forward to attend PyConIndia, which should be affordable.</description></item></channel></rss>
