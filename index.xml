&lt;p>The learning from this activity is quite a long list.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Visualization is easier compared to data collection &amp;amp; preparation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>UI is scarier than the backend stuff like terminal or notebooks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prototyping is very much important, especially for the hobby project.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Iterative improvement is greater than aiming for a polished shiny thing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Presentation is key&lt;/li>

I came across the annual reviews on the FreeFinCal site; it&amp;rsquo;s a shame I couldn&amp;rsquo;t recall the exact year. My guess would be somewhere between 2018 and 2020.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the pandemic, I started subscribing to the Substacks. I noticed almost everyone who is regularly writing is reviewing the annual performance. And I always wanted to write one for myself. The birthdays, New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eves, and financial year-end—all of them provided a chance to write. All these days were an opportunity to sit down and look back at what has happened.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>IPL: Ways to see beyond Scoreboard</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2025/03/ipl-ways-to-see-beyond-scoreboard/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2025/03/ipl-ways-to-see-beyond-scoreboard/</guid><description>&lt;p>Data visualization is one field that has kept me captivated for some time now. The graphics published in sites like FT, Reuters, or NYT made me wonder why I don&amp;rsquo;t spend time on the skill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The good volume and variety of data that is available is available all the time. Share market—daily; IPL—yearly. I find each of the cricket matches, no matter if they are Test, ODI, or T20, generates so much data. I tried once with the ODI World Cup; it&amp;rsquo;s not at all a good one. It&amp;rsquo;s been a couple of years, and I&amp;rsquo;m planning to visualize this IPL. My preferred tool is D3JS, and even with that, I&amp;rsquo;m limited to a few shapes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Over-confidence is the safety risk</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/12/over-confidence-is-the-safety-risk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/12/over-confidence-is-the-safety-risk/</guid><description>&lt;p>Few years ago, I was working in a Chennai, 500 KM away from Coimbatore, where my family resides.

With a huge crowd looking to travel back on long weekends, reserving a seat was not easiest thing to do. I booked my ticket a week back and in relaxed manner went to boarding point. While checking the ticket I noticed the booking was for previous day.

&lt;h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m part of Data landscape for more than a decade now. I started as ETL developer, then evolved into Data Engineer. When I was crawling the ETL world, the Data Scientists were already declared as the &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century">sexiest job&lt;/a>, and Big Data was a novelty. The 1st time I heard about the power of the data and analytics was from the famous &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/">Forbes article on Target&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>I started following the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@muthaleetukalam">channel&lt;/a> during the lockdown, just like million other self-proclaimed investors. The channel is not for trader/speculator/FnO players or gamblers. The videos pops up everyday since the lockdown times. The primary theme is investor behavior, or current events with respect of finance or economics. Some day special guests gets featured, to share their experience.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Event Update: Consecration</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/08/event-update-consecration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/08/event-update-consecration/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m in the midway between an atheist, agnostic and a religious person. My particiaption in events based out of religious tradition, is almost always doubtful. Yet, I was part of this community gathering, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to cover the event.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- What it is and when? -->
&lt;p>When a temple gets built, it deserves sequence of rituals that adds spiritual and religious power to the deity living in the temple. As it is a belief based system, logical questioing doesn&amp;rsquo;t end well. The event took place on August 17-19, 2024.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Prayer</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/08/my-prayer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/08/my-prayer/</guid><description>&lt;p>To start with I&amp;rsquo;m not a religious person. Meaning I don&amp;rsquo;t strictly follow the religious activities, I do constantly question the practises. I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether I&amp;rsquo;m an atheist or an agnostic. But I do believe there could be some powerful entity. Could be a god, family of gods or nature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I was living abroad for the work purpose, I need a social interaction. That made me to visit temple every week, almost. I do consider myself a rational person, so the conventional prayers like asking the God to give this or that made no sense. After all it is an all knowing entity. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t it knows what should be given to me?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Analog Clock</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/07/analog-clock/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/07/analog-clock/</guid><description>&lt;p>First we started with a circle. The dial is composed of a bigger circle and a smaller one - a center point.&lt;/p>
&lt;body>
 &lt;div class="one">&lt;/div>
 &lt;script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js">&lt;/script>
 &lt;script src="./1.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;/body>
&lt;p>With the dial is in place, next step is to add arms of the clock. The end result should have 3 arms - depicting hours, minutes and seconds. To have quicker feedback we started with seconds arm.&lt;/p>
&lt;body>
 &lt;div class="two">&lt;/div>
 &lt;script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js">&lt;/script>
 &lt;script src="./2.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;/body>
&lt;p>Drawing the radius solves the initial position of seconds arm. However, to have the arm goes around the clock, we need to calculate &lt;code>(x,y)&lt;/code> coordinates.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Investing in real estates</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/05/investing-in-real-estates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/05/investing-in-real-estates/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a write up on my thoughts abour real estate as investment.

&lt;!-- How it works - big in capital -->
&lt;p>To describe my disinterest towards RE, first we should see how the system works with respect to RE. To make it clear I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about REITs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is entirely unregulated space. Meaning, there is no check and balance to help the consumers. With no regulations, the black money is very very common. As the transaction is under the regulator&amp;rsquo;s radar, there is no place to approach for any type of grievances.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learnings from working with external teams</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/04/learnings-from-working-with-external-teams/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/04/learnings-from-working-with-external-teams/</guid><description>&lt;p>With the recent change in the role from data engineer to &lt;a href="https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/03/reflections-on-recent-changes-in-work-place/">lead data engineer&lt;/a>, I&amp;rsquo;m regularly interacting with different teams, both upstream and downstream.

&lt;p>It might annoy us to hear about diversity from the MNCs again and again. However, for the proper functioning of the organization, it is essential to have associates from various backgrounds. This plurality ensures different ideas and approaches to a problem, which in turn gives the authorities the ability to compare and pick a better, more efficient solution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reflections on recent changes in work place</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/03/reflections-on-recent-changes-in-work-place/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/03/reflections-on-recent-changes-in-work-place/</guid><description>&lt;p>The last few weeks have been tough. The problem seems to originate from all three avenues: life, work, and the social circle. My child is demanding that I play with her more regularly and for more time. By size, my social circle is small. I feel the size further shrinks due to my inability to speak or interact with my close friends. Even though the friends usually accept the fact that life is getting busier, the crack appears nonetheless.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tax and Death</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/02/tax-and-death/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/02/tax-and-death/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>You owe some money to the land where you live. Most of the countries collect it income tax, some countries do survive without collecting income tax[2]. Having said that Income Tax is not the only tax the state can impose. It charge us via some other means too - corporate tax, Value added tax or Service/sales tax.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reflection on daily journaling</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/02/reflection-on-daily-journaling/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2024/02/reflection-on-daily-journaling/</guid><description>&lt;p>The last quarter of 2023 was spent away from family for work related in a nordic country.

&lt;p>To keep myself from overthinking or having negative thoughts, I should focus my energy on something creative. Also, the creativity should pique my curiosity. Essentially, I should spend time learning something. Personal finance is something that we monitor and learn about in a daily manner. The PF has a variety of numbers and data to deal with.

&lt;p>Data Engineering is my day job. SQL and Python have fed me and kept me going for last decade. For the uninitiated, the work involves fetching data from several sources and loading into desired target. The &lt;em>source&lt;/em> and &lt;em>target&lt;/em> could be a database, API endpoint, or file.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What do you pray for</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/09/what-do-you-pray-for/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/09/what-do-you-pray-for/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="consoling-a-crying-child">Consoling a crying child&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Last week, my kid fell ill. It was a viral fever with cold. Due to the intense cold, she was struggling to breathe and had ear pain. We were constantly clearing up the nasal passage and helping her with breathing. However, she was helpless with ear pain. As per the pediatrician&amp;rsquo;s instructions, we gave her a tonic to relieve her ear pain. The medicine is not a magic potion to heal instantaneously; it was slow process. Her body takes time to act on it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/visuals/sitemap/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/visuals/sitemap/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="visual-sitemap">Visual Sitemap&lt;/h1>

The things she learns and the way she communicates is intriguing me. To be frank, I believe almost every kid does the same, more or less. But as I am seeing her development from very close I do observe on how she learns.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- 1. Imitatates what an elder does. repeating -->
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Imitation&lt;/strong>: She imitates us. Whatever we do she tries to replicate us. For example, she tries to saute the imaginary food on her toy kitchen set.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;!-- 2. Does learn from everyone, adult, elder sibling, animals, birds. No ego. -->
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>No Ego&lt;/strong>: They doesn&amp;rsquo;t decide on whom to copy from. She mimics what her cousin does. The cousin we are talking about is barely an year old. She sees something new, she copis it; no discrimination on age.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;!-- 3. Questions without thinking what others will think -->
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Not thinking what others thinking&lt;/strong>: She doesn&amp;rsquo;t consider what others thinking. Isn&amp;rsquo;t it this factor stops us from doing what we love. Having said that, sometimes she screams in public place irritating fellow beings.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;!-- 4. Pattern matching. Kinnam vs kannam -->
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Identifying patterns&lt;/strong>: Numbers are abstract concept for a toddler. Yet, on saying 3, she runs. Its more like a pattern matching than understanding 1-2-3.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;!-- 5. Observing all the time -->
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Observing all the time&lt;/strong>: There is no dedicated learning time for her. She just goes on to observer and mimic all the time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fumbling 145 days long kindle reading streak</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/06/fumbling-145-days-long-kindle-reading-streak/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/06/fumbling-145-days-long-kindle-reading-streak/</guid><description>&lt;p>If my memory serves right, Snapchat popularised the &lt;em>streak&lt;/em> phenomena.

&lt;li>Tooltip - Earlier, we were employing the browser&amp;rsquo;s native tooltip. With this update we have customised tooltip with publish date and categories along with the title of post.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>There are few changes made to the chart.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Today marker: Instead of drawing a full line for the current year, we are allowing the line to grow with passing day. This is a major change.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Transition: The trasnition effects are the major change here. Ironically, the amount of code change is minimum - tbh addition of 2 lines is all that&amp;rsquo;s needed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hyperlinks: All the hyperlinks are made colored with dark blue, as this is the &lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links_colors.asp#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20a%20link%20will,link%20is%20underlined%20and%20red">default color&lt;/a> in all browsers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tooltip: We have used &lt;code>title&lt;/code> tag to implement the tooltip. This is not a major change or in other words the tooltip can be better. For that we have to go for CSS method, which is still a bit far from my reach.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

Instead of building a spaghetti code that just works, we are approaching the entire process through the industry practise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, the working components are modularised for easier maintenance. These individual modules are built on TDD approach, testing with every step of our development. The test results are passed through coverage to understand how much code is covered under our testing process. And, based on this coverage status the code is committed into Git repo. This regulates clean and working code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Personal help/maid affordability - a social indicator?</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/01/personal-help/maid-affordability-a-social-indicator/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 12:22:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/01/personal-help/maid-affordability-a-social-indicator/</guid><description>&lt;!-- Spreading rumour/stealing are not a big issue. -->

&lt;p>Everyone of us think(or worry) about future, especially in 30s. Likewise, I worry about financial stability of my future. The retirement comes top of the list among the various worries. And so, I started investement. The investment includes various vahicles - Mutual fund, stocks and fixed components. Investing is a beast; tracking the investment is like taming the beast. For tracking the progress there are (literally) endless apps coming into to market. You must either trade in your data or pay for some freemium features.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Migrated to blogdown</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2022/10/migrated-to-blogdown/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2022 12:22:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2022/10/migrated-to-blogdown/</guid><description>&lt;!-- What was the setup before change? -->
&lt;p>I was using Hugo for static site generation with Beautiful Hugo as a theme. The theme is known for its balancing act between simplicity and proseness for a blog. With Hugo its a fast act to creating and publishing the contents.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- What are we missing? -->
&lt;p>It was all good until I wanted to embed a HTML page. iFrame is always there but including the charts, especially interactive ones generated as HTML is tough to embed in the post (at least for me). I do feel interactive charts are better than the static charts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Meta</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/_meta-credits/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/_meta-credits/</guid><description>&lt;style>

&lt;p>During the last months of every financial year, there is a tradition, a custom to keep ourselves sane - ranting on tax that we suffered through the year, and any returns we can expect from the taxmen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In one of the ranting sessions, we had an interesting conversation.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>How much tax are we paying?&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>What is so interesting?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The tax must be &lt;a href="https://cleartax.in/s/income-tax-slabs">either 25% (new regime) or 30% (old regime)&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hugo Site Deployment Using Github Actions</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2022/05/hugo-site-deployment-using-github-actions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 May 2022 19:50:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2022/05/hugo-site-deployment-using-github-actions/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a small write up about setting up GitHub Actions to deploy Hugo site.&lt;/p>

Later on, with the comfort of the soft surface, she was rolling around without caring about her head getting hurt or gravity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everything got changed when we let her crawl on the hard surface in the living room. She was getting hurt quite frequently - sometimes stepping on a toy, or hard landing on her head while rolling on the floor, or simply butting on something at her head level. Slowly, she got learned to avoid those hurting her. These days she evaluates the surfaces before taking another step.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Notes</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/reads/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/reads/</guid><description>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

As a CEO, he was blamed for being CEO on Square and not concentrating on Twitter.&lt;/p>

Being an ETL developer turned Data Engineer, my work is to fetch data from different sources, cleaning it, and making it consumption ready before storing it in some storage space - database, S3 et al.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s amusing to know that someone will be consuming this data and pull insights from it like a magician pulling a rabbit off his hat. The reporting tools were the go-to place to churn these processed data. The decision-makers use the reports generated by these tools. The reports are mostly limited to tables, bar, line, or pie charts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Power of Open Data</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2021/07/power-of-open-data/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 22:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2021/07/power-of-open-data/</guid><description>&lt;p>Amidst the pandemic, tracking the daily case numbers from the government bulletin became a habit for us.

&lt;p>The distance between the decision-makers and us is more than the distance between Moon and Earth. Yet, we discuss as if to guide the entire state. The discussions usually raise some questions on the back story about the rise or fall of numbers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Longreads with Kindle</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2021/05/longreads-with-kindle/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 May 2021 21:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2021/05/longreads-with-kindle/</guid><description>&lt;p>E-Commerce, eBooks, Prime Video &amp;amp; music even for some AWS. This is the list of items that my close surroundings say about Amazon&amp;rsquo;s domain. Kindle is mostly overlooked or not prominently known among people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kindle is a strange product from Amazon. Unlike its Video/music or retail site, Kindle appeals to a narrow circle - readers. Even among the readers, there is a &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/which-is-better-ebooks-or-paper-books-1625005600">split&lt;/a> between ebook and physical book readers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Firstly, it&amp;rsquo;s the only hardware product from Amazon. The hardware is not some cheap plastic. The device boasts a solid design, handy to carry around, easier to handle in a single hand. The battery is one of the key factors, once fully charged the device runs for weeks.
.Secondly, unlike other products Kindle helps us to build a constructive habit - reading. Third, once you acquire Kindle you can circumvent Amazon entirely and no need to pay. The hardware superiority and goodness of reading have been covered by so many blogs. Here, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how I&amp;rsquo;m using Kindle to use Kindle.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AWS Certified Solution Architect - for whom, why and how</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2021/04/aws-certified-solution-architect-for-whom-why-and-how/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Apr 2021 09:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2021/04/aws-certified-solution-architect-for-whom-why-and-how/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;em>Certifications are a waste of time&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>.

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Raspberry Pi running in home, for last 10 months. Until a month ago, the sole purpose of the RPi is to &lt;a href="https://dheepakg.github.io/diy/2019/06/17/no-more-ad-breaks.html">filter off the ads&lt;/a> using Pi-hole&lt;sup id="a1">&lt;a href="#f1">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, then a speed test module was scheduled to run on it. By the setup, the speedtest-cli runs every 10 mins and fetches internet into csv file. the plan is to arrive to some meaningful conclusion of the data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Comparison of various HDFS file formats</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2020/02/comparison-of-various-hdfs-file-formats/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2020 13:47:17 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2020/02/comparison-of-various-hdfs-file-formats/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with Big data since 2017. As I&amp;rsquo;m from data warehousing background, it was easier for me to understand what&amp;rsquo;s what, and build an analogy between DWH &amp;amp; big data frameworks. However, the various file formats used in HDFS always caught me off guard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In DWH, I never considered how the files are stored in DB, it&amp;rsquo;s managed by the database, maybe DBA might know how its done at the backend, as a DB developer it never bothered me. However, in HDFS we have several types of formats to choose from - &lt;em>Avro, ORC &amp;amp; Parquet.&lt;/em> The best way to understand something is to spend time with it. So, decided to see how the different files behave for same data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The 2010s - Part 2</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2020/01/the-2010s-part-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jan 2020 15:14:27 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2020/01/the-2010s-part-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is 2&lt;sup>nd&lt;/sup> installment of the story.

&lt;p>&lt;code>rustup&lt;/code>- Used to update the latest Rust version.
&lt;code>rustc filename.rs&lt;/code> - Used to compile rust source code.
&lt;code>rustdoc&lt;/code> - Rust documentation is generated from this command. This can generate documentation from markdown files. Also, it show the Rustbook opens in browser when called as &lt;code>rustup docs&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Project initialization&lt;/strong>
After installing Rust, we should initialize a project using &lt;code>Cargo&lt;/code>
&lt;code>cargo init project_path&lt;/code> -
This will create a project folder of below file structure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What makes Rust interesting?</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2019/08/what-makes-rust-interesting/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2019 11:24:27 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2019/08/what-makes-rust-interesting/</guid><description>&lt;p>Podcasts. That&amp;rsquo;s how I got introduced to the Rust language.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In one of the PythonBytes &lt;a href="https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/138/will-pyoxidizer-weld-shut-one-of-python-s-major-gaps">episode&lt;/a> I heard about the PyOxidizer for the first time. Basically, it uses Rust to bundle Python code into an &lt;a href="https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2019/06/24/building-standalone-python-applications-with-pyoxidizer/">executable code&lt;/a>. There is already quite a number of modules to convert code into an executable file. According to Michael Kennedy, the Git repo is so active, that made me to explore what the PyOxidizer is made of. Surprise, Surprise! Its made an amalgamation of Rust and Python, in 80-20 ratio.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Yes, humanity exists</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2019/07/yes-humanity-exists/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2019 23:17:27 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2019/07/yes-humanity-exists/</guid><description>&lt;p>The social media is made of several bubbles.

&lt;p>This is what happened to me in recent times. There is some negative news keep getting shared to me via whatsapp, twitter or facebook. The negativity comes in the form of political corruption to pedophilia.

The Podcasts became a thing with the iPods. Even the term itself &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p038m811">derived&lt;/a> from the Apple&amp;rsquo;s gadget. Off late, with the arrival of 3&lt;sup>rd&lt;/sup> party apps, more people from Android are attracted, along with the Apple users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Apple, iTunes enables us to listen to Podcast. Google released their own &lt;a href="https://podcasts.google.com/about">app&lt;/a> very recently and the customization is very limited.

The nature will adapt to the changes. But, the new earth will no way close to the one we have now. Also, we got deviated from the natural evolution. Our life became sophisticated, without the necessary infrastructure we will kill ourself in the name of depression.

&lt;p>Pi-hole is an interesting project, claims to be black hole of Ads. I guess the &lt;em>pi&lt;/em> in the name refers to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">Raspberry Pi&lt;/a>. As my Pi3 was lying in the corner unused, I went for the Pi-hole installation. Before continuing further on the experience, we need to discuss why the ads are bothering?&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="whats-wrong-with-ads">What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with ads?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I agree the ads are the revenue source of websites. They are good as long as they don&amp;rsquo;t obstruct the usage, but do they? If not, we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have went for browser level Ad blockers in first place. Having an Ad blocker in browser works good. But, this may impact performance of the browser. There are &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-chrome-ad-blockers-extensions-api/">news that claims&lt;/a> Google may break the working of Ad blockers in Chrome. The situation of smartphones are mush worse. Especially, in Android. There are no regulation, even in the popular apps, the Ads are placed in every available real estate. The expectation is to hijack your attention when you accidentally touch these spaces. There are apps which can protect you from ads, you&amp;rsquo;ve to sideload them, but sideloading an app is not a safe option.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First serious project that has some rational application</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2019/05/first-serious-project-that-has-some-rational-application/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 May 2019 23:15:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2019/05/first-serious-project-that-has-some-rational-application/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m working in a corporate firm which employs 100K+ employees. As do with any organization of such a magnitude, there are certain rules &amp;amp; policies which cannot be breached. In most of the occasions, the policies really help us navigate without much of the issue. Yet, there are situations which impedes our progress.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The impedement I felt was merging PDF files. What&amp;rsquo;s there to worry about, you may wonder. In our org, we have some version of Adobe Reader to view PDFs. Eventhough I&amp;rsquo;m not a big fan of Adobe, there are no alternatives in &lt;a href="https://alternativeto.net/software/adobe-reader/">my workplace&lt;/a> that I know of, at least.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cheapest&lt;/strong> - Free to use GH Pages. You may not get a dedicated domain, but you&amp;rsquo;ll get a &lt;em>name&lt;/em>.github.io&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Practical&lt;/strong> - You can go for blogger or wordPress for writing a blog post. However, you&amp;rsquo;ll never get to experience the nitty-gritty involved with running an actual website.&lt;/p>

The nation saw some of the interesting transformations, which would be an unimaginable tale even a decade earlier for Geo-political experts. The changes ranges from Economic stance of the country to opening up to private cable channels to introduction of Internet to the masses (the snail-paced dial-ups).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The election commission too hopped into the transformation train. From the conventional paper based ballot, the Electronic Voting Machines were introduced. As like any other new stuff, this was unwelcomed by many, especially every losing party started blaming on the foul play surrounding the EVM. To mitigate the foul play, as a 2nd level defense, the EC introduced &lt;a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/india/what-is-vvpat/articleshow/68667136.cms">VVPAT system&lt;/a>.

Interpreting it could be final frontier for AI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Understanding Sarcastic line is a complex process. Depends on lots of variables — context, body language, tone modulation and so on. To be fair there is not proper/scientific way to decode sarcasm. To add to it, degree of closeness is (kinda) proportional to complexity of sarcasm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In one of the scene Deadpool 2 movie, the lead actor was questioned who he is. Responding, he says, “I’m Batman”. The whole theater erupts in laughter.

&lt;p>This is the question which started a long conversation with my friend over Whatsapp.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why does it matter? Everything depends on the answer. If it’s Occupation, you can tax them for the revenue, likewise you can insure them so they can land safe in times of tragedy. Or if its a welfare, government can take it or some NGOs can chip in with funding from benevolent sponsors.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Democracy, a silver bullet?</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2017/05/democracy-a-silver-bullet/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 May 2017 22:47:17 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2017/05/democracy-a-silver-bullet/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m a big fan of Democratic government.
