&lt;p>Right now the project focuses on creating dashboard for Mutual funds, and gradually adding other investement vehicles viz stocks, PPF, and EPF.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="fetching-navs">Fetching NAVs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To track the mutual funds, we come across an API by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuvarajl/">Yuvaraj Loganathan&lt;/a> - &lt;a href="https://www.mfapi.in/">MFAPI&lt;/a>. Thank you, Yuvaraj. The API gets updated on daily basis and free to access (as in free beer). For our project, which is not intended for any financial gain, this api is the right fit.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Project Update - 3</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/01/project-update-3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2023 12:22:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/01/project-update-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is continuation in the series about our side project. This post is a follow up to the pervious &lt;a href="post-055-2023-01-22-pf-dashboard-2.md">post on various tools&lt;/a> used to build the process of building the application&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- Python version -->
&lt;h3 id="the-environment">The Environment&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Core language used in our project is Python. Python is used to fetch details from API calls, cleaning the API return value, and also writing it into DB. Even though the language is very popular and user ranges from amateurs to big corporations, it undergoes development. Implying the new versions are created and released often. And so, setting up the environment is necessary.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Project Update - 2</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/01/project-update-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2023 12:22:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/01/project-update-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a continuation to previous post on our new &lt;a href="post-054-2023-01-01-pf-dashboard-1.md">side project&lt;/a>. Instead of building a spaghetti code that just works, we are approaching the entire process through the industry practise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, the working components are modularised for easier maintenance. These individual modules are built on TDD approach, testing with every step of our development. The test results are passed through coverage to understand how much code is covered under our testing process. And, based on this coverage status the code is committed into Git repo. This regulates clean and working code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Project Update - 1</title><link>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/01/project-update-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 12:22:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://dheepakg.github.io/post/2023/01/project-update-1/</guid><description>&lt;!-- Problem statement - Why? Artos is limited. Lets build it ourself. Mention various apps you tried;
complaining is easy, lets try to build and experience the pain-->
&lt;p>Everyone of us think(or worry) about future, especially in 30s. Likewise, I worry about financial stability of my future. The retirement comes top of the list among the various worries. And so, I started investement. The investment includes various vahicles - Mutual fund, stocks and fixed components. Investing is a beast; tracking the investment is like taming the beast. For tracking the progress there are (literally) endless apps coming into to market. You must either trade in your data or pay for some freemium features.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
