This is 2<sup>nd</sup> installment of the story. I'm trying to arrange beautiful photos of the last decade. The photos are all captured by me.

##### The foggy view of training center on a December morning. The first time I had a taste of resort-like place.

##### The Kevin Mitnick replied and followed me, after a tweet about Ghost in the Wires

##### This was one only outreach programme that I took part in. The experience was good eye opening. It showed me state of the primary school education, which was frightening.

##### A bachelor den. More-or-less this was a typical arrangement of our residence. Green-thingy was the mosquito net, without which you can't protect your blood. Addition to ceiling fan, we had 2 table fans. Even thats not enough for the Chennai summer. And so, we used up the another option. Check out next photo.

##### The fore mentioned green-thingy enabled us to sleep on open terrace. Compared to sleeping on terrace, the camp-fire can go aside. Dozing off while staring at stars & sky, waking up to the chirping birds and screaming trains. Also, you should be ready to run inside when the rain drops in. Also, setting up of the bed on terrace takes time.

##### The Chennai Flood. The natural calamity that I been part of. We always change the TV channel when the visuals of calamity is shown; believe me, once you experienced it, you'll pray to the lord, even though you're an atheist.

##### My first air travel. I resented for not getting the window seat. But, after the transit I got the window seat. To be honest the aisle seats are much butter to stretch legs and reach out to rest room.

##### My favorite dish is dosa. And, I'm not a fan of chocolate bars. The first day on the foreign land, this was the breakfast. This acted as catalyst for me to learn cooking.

##### The popular Chicago Skyline. I was grateful to the weather god for allowing the sunshine on that day. WATER! LAND! SKY! This photo reminds me of the [Centurions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn49zxXRHhA)

##### As a Chennai resident, I lived through 2 seasons - Summer & very hot summer. But the US of A boasted of 4 seasons - Spring, Summer, Fall & Winter. Each season has its own speciality.

- Spring - life springs back after the brutal winter;
- Summer - time when people stay outside of house more than staying in;
- Fall - the leaves fall down, with colorful display;
- Winter - shows that hell needn't be always hot.

##### You remember Prison Break TV series? This is the prison that keep appearing in the Season 1. It's an abandoned prison in Joliet, Il. The time we went there some teenagers were tearing apart the fence and getting inside against the _prohibited _ sign. We took handful of photos and drove away.

#### Snow flakes. This was captured from my car on a snowy day.

##### This was the view from the backside of my house. When it snows, you can hardly see any creatures roaming around. May be in arctics or in wild some animals could roam. But the social-animal-named-humans won't be seen when the earth is black-and-white.

##### My favoritest photo. Captured from my workplace. It's like an entire ecosystem - lake, stream, road, dead trees & office space.
