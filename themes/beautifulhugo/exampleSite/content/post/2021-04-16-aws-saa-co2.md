**_Certifications are a waste of time_**. It's not unreasonable as I came across dumps (aka recent questions, question banks). Once you memorize the contents of the question bank, you can score cent percent. _Memorise answers and recall them in the exam hall, score a pass mark_ - a common theme in schools and colleges. I went through it as there are no alternatives. But in the post-academic stage of life, I was hesitant to follow the same approach in office. My point was simple,
> _Should I grab a certification with zero knowledge? What possible purpose does it fulfill?_.

 The notorious certificates were often from Oracle and Microsoft. And to date, I don't have a high opinion of the two. These two being giants among enterprise software makers, I assumed every one of them will be following the same with their certifications. Naturally, I didn't care much about the _certified developers_.

Time changes. My career path crossed with the then new-age technology. In early-2017, I started working in Cloud Computing and Big data via AWS. And to learn that I was asked to take certifications. That's the 1<sup>st</sup> time I came across AWS certification and I was clearly warned that the exam is not a cakewalk.

Ignoring the warnings I  went through the FAQ of AWS services and tried a mock test. The results were amazing, I couldn't even understand/recall the names of AWS services that were talked about in the exam. Then I realized,
> _Clearing the exam is tough. It's not a simple memorize-and-recall-to-pass type of exam_

Then I realized _the certification_ is worth the time and effort

### AWS Certification is for Whom?
 - If you're working in AWS cloud computing you should take it up.
 - Or if you want to change your path and break onto cloud computing, spend time and take it up

### Why be certified?
 - Preparing for certification makes you gain knowledge on the services which may not be used by you in your daily work.
   -  In my case, I never used Networking and Security related services and I had zero knowledge of it. But through this certification, I got to know and understand the services.
- Gives you confidence in AWS services and you can ace interviews, at the least, you'll be confident working on the ecosystem.
- Adding a badge to a LinkedIn profile helps us grab the attention of the recruiters.


### How to do it?
There are various courses available on the web. Subscribe/buy them, get yourself prepared. Then go through practice exams. Once you're consistently scoring a good percentage and you're confident of your performance, you can book a slot for the exam.

### Which?

To start with we have 3 options
1.  AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
2.  AWS Certified Developer - Associate
3.  AWS Certified Solution Architect - Associate


> </br>My consistent advice is to ignore the practitioner.. even as a newbie. Yes its low level, but in my experience has almost 0 value to employer. Even for you personally .. its so base level, that the knowledge you gain will be next to useless. </br>
> I always suggest to people (even people with NO AWS or even NO IT knowledge) to start with the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate certification.

### How long?

There are people taking the exam with few weeks of practising. But I took several breaks in between. I bought Udemy course on 2018 Christmas holidays. Got certified on February 2021. So, it all depends on your ability and pririties.
