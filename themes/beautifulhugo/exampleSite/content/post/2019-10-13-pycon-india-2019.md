[comment]: <> (How do you got to know about pycon )
My primary source of Python and Python related news was/is [Python podcast](https://talkpython.fm), since 2016. In 2018, I came to know about Pycon taking place in Cleveland, OH. [Dan Bader's vlog on PyCon '18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDVlqeOT2XY&list=PLP8GkvaIxJP281FqVlJBgHGyMRvP9NtYN) was another pull factor towards the PyCon. Due to the ticket pricing I couldn't make it to it. In H2 of 2018, I returned to India, and was looking forward to attend PyConIndia, which should be affordable.

[comment]: <> (Ticket booking)
PyConIndia '19 is taking place in Chennai, which happened to be my second home. There can't be anymore reason to miss the conference. The ticket booking opened for PyConIndia on one fine day. Then I did booked a ticket, sadly couldn't book the early bird ticket.

**An Unexpected High Level Meeting**

The conference is scheduled to start from Oct 12<sup>th</sup>. Out of nowhere a new development in the horizon, on Oct 11 - 12, India's PM Modi and Chinese Premier Xi are having a meeting in Mahabalipuram, coastal town nearby Chennai. To be honest there were days when I was wishing world leaders do visit Chennai, but not on this day.

The leaders are meeting what's this to do with the planned conference, you ask? As the leaders are high profile, it's expected the regular operation of Chennai would be impacted. Worst part, the travel route of the leaders is right through the roads leading to the venue.

**The First Day**
On day 1, the conference is supposed to start at 9 am, and the registration at 8 am. To avoid unexpected hustle, I reached the venue at 7.40 am itself, quite unusual from me. After the registration the below sponsorship board welcomed me. What a sight it is been.

[comment]: <> (Talks - keynote, comunity, manikandan, Harsha, Jaisingh, Digital Domain, Maho Jose institute)
The keynote is from [Jake](https://twitter.com/jakevdp?lang=en). The path of Python from 90s to today. It's underwhelming to say its informativa. After the Keynote, came in talks. Few of the interesting talks were,

- Anand's talk on GeoPandas
- Pradyun talk on Packaging. This guy is PSF fellow, and a UG student
- Abhishek detailing of GraphQL from ELI5 to technical implementation. Outstanding.
- [Abdul](https://datascienceplus.com/author/abdulmajed-raja/) talked about [ML bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdbyH-Z98vA&feature=youtu.be) is a must watch
- Listening to the talks in the Silent Conference Room was a different experience. There were no noise or disturbance. It should be everywhere already.
- Bloomberg guys talked about need for unit-test. I should spend time over here.

Apart from talks, the open space talks was informative. Came across [Harsha](https://twitter.com/NeerDoseMonster). This guy maintains Kubernetes in his company. He talked about need for contributing to FOSS.

[comment]: <> (Day 2, tirkarthi, David Beasley, more talks)
**Fanboy moment** - On Day 2, I met [Karthi](https://twitter.com/tirkarthi), a core dev of Python, been following his blog and tweets for some days now.

**Beazley.. Beazley..**
Yes, that was the chant from the crowd when the closing note was delayed by MC. This was the first time I came across this guy. HE. IS. AMAZING.:clap: Screencasted his session - [A Talk Near the Future of Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-A78RgMhZU) to the hypnotized audience.

[comment]: <> (Experience, todo, see you next time)

To conclude the learning of the conference, I realized it's high time to strengthen the Python basics. That's a long todo for me

**Thanks for the experience**
I like to thank the volunteers, coordinators, sponsors, speakers, food committee and everyone else for making my first tech conference a great memeory.
