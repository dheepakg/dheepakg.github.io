Amidst the pandemic, tracking the daily case numbers from the government bulletin became a habit for us. For a small circle of friends involving 3-4 guys, it's a routine to dissect the numbers and get meaning from the case number.

The distance between the decision-makers and us is more than the distance between Moon and Earth. Yet, we discuss as if to guide the entire state. The discussions usually raise some questions on the back story about the rise or fall of numbers.

We all believe underreporting is an open secret. Yet, there was a continuity in the chart. Meaning, 100 new people tested positive for a day implies existing case count will increment by 100. There was no discrepancy until July 6<sup>th</sup>.

We raised the question on Twitter - [here](https://twitter.com/Innovfaizal/status/1412419610092216322?) and [here](https://twitter.com/dheeepakg/status/1412425310050471936). Like other million tweets, this too went unanswered. Later, we got to know that the discrepancy in number is not a scam/malicious act. The inflow of cases from neighboring districts contributed to the spike in the case count.

#### What does this signify?

1. The absence of a college degree is no longer an obstacle to understand and raise questions.
2. Authorities can no longer hide behind bureaucracy
3. Free and open data could decentralize truthfulness.

Scholars and Academics are well aware of the importance of open data. Indian Government has acknowledged it and has set up [Open Data Platform for Smart cities](https://smartcities.data.gov.in/). Yet, the COVID made the data collation and number crunching a sexy thing to do.

#### India, a reactive nation

We as a country have always been reactive.

- The famines of 60's pushed us into the Green revolution
- The Sino-Indian war of 1962 made us create R&AW.
- 1991 Indian economic crisis bought us liberalization.

By the same lines, can we expect post-COVID India would be welcoming open data access?
