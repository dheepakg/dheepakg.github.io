Amidst the second wave of COVID, a data analyst receives a tweet questioning a discrepancy. The [data analyst](https://twitter.com/vijay27anand) is quite popular in the state for his daily analysis of COVID case count and 15k+ people following him.

One of the questions was about a blip in the stats provided by authorities. [My friend](https://twitter.com/Innovfaizal) raised the question,

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is there any false count happening with Coimbatore covid cases!!! There is addition of around 200 cases over night to the active cases in treatment count. Its happened yesterday and even today <a href="https://twitter.com/muruga_TNIE?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@muruga_TNIE</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mannar_mannan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@mannar_mannan</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/vijay27anand?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@vijay27anand</a></p>&mdash; Faizy (@Innovfaizal) <a href="https://twitter.com/Innovfaizal/status/1412419610092216322?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The question was simple. Like other million tweets, this too went unanswered. We got to know that the discrepancy in number is not a scam/malicious act. The inflow of cases from neighboring districts contributed to the spike in the case count.

**What does this signify?**

1. The absence of a college degree is no longer an obstacle to understand and raise questions.
2. Authorities can no longer hide behind bureaucracy
3. Free and open data could decentralize truthfulness.

Scholars and Academics are well aware of the importance of open data. Indian Government has acknowledged it and has set up [Open Data Platform for Smart cities](https://smartcities.data.gov.in/). Yet, the COVID made the data collation and number crunching a sexy thing to do.

**India, a reactive nation**

We as a country have always been reactive.
- The famines of 60's pushed us into the Green revolution
- The Sino-Indian war of 1962 made us create R&AW.
- 1991 Indian economic crisis bought us liberalization.

By the same lines, can we expect post-COVID India would be welcoming open data access?
