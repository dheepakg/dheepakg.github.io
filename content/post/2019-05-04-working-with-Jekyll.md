It's cool to have a personal website. As a novice, where to start? The cheapest, practical and programmatic option is [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

**Cheapest** - Free to use GH Pages. You may not get a dedicated domain, but you'll get a *name*.github.io

**Practical** - You can go for blogger or wordPress for writing a blog post. However, you'll never get to experience the nitty-gritty involved with running an actual website.

**Programmatic** - Once you started programming, it will be intriguing to learn something new.

How does having GHP can make a difference?
It's not straight forward to maintain GHP, you should put in some honest efforts to build the site from nothing. The necessary skills to have are,
* Git - Proficiency in Git is a basics for a programmer. By using GitHub to host your site, you get more exposure on a long run.
* Markdown - We all know how human-unfriendly html can be. This is a simple markup language, acts as an alternative for HTML. You can do a lot over a [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
* HTML & CSS - The markdown comes as an alternative to some extent, yet HTML & CSS are unavoidable for a website. You need to tinker with these to get your frontend right.

**Finally, the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).**
It's a static site generator, written on Ruby. And, it doesn't matter what the previous sentence means. Just remember, its a simple tool that's going to help you with site generation. Just follow below steps in the order.
*  **Install Jekyll** - This bugger is written on Ruby. Ruby runs on all OS - Linux, Windows or Mac. So, whatever your choice is Ruby is there. On top of Ruby, [install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
* **Initialize the site** - Just refer the [official docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to build your site. You can view your site on http://localhost:4000.
* **Tinkering** - Now start tinkering with your UI. You can try out wide variety of [themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/). The community is so benevolent to offer many themes for free. Also, so there are themes that comes for a price, if you afford.
* **Deployment** - Once everything looks good, you can push the changes to Github. One thing to keep in mind is to have the Git repo as *username*.github.io

The GitHub supports Jekyll site natively. Meaning, the test-site that worked on Jekyll results in a site, when a pushed to Github.
