Here, I want to discuss about an unexpected outcome from interview. Contrary to the 'rona times, I felt happy and contented.

The interview is usually a stressful affair. I usually prepare _100s_ of topics, then the interviewer will bombard me with _101<sup>st</sup>_ topic. Well, its just a déjà vu, nothing new with the session.

The interviewer was friendly and made me absolutely comfortable, there were no stress-inducing questions, all through the entire discussion.

And then, I asked for feedback, which is entirely new from my end. This guy gave few feedbacks on how to think and approach a new tool. That was not new either, but it blew me off. Sudden in rush of dopamine and felt as if I got the job position itself, to be frank I'm most likely to flunk. But I felt satisfied, energised.

Have a happy dappy day.
