This is the third instalment of weekly update. Let's revisit the interesting things that I came across in between last Monday and today (September 13, 2020). Word count at 800.


## Some interesting items from the past week

### The AIIMS Story

I happened to read about the founder of AIIMS - Rajkumari Amrit Kaur. [This piece](https://indianexpress.com/article/research/rajkumari-amrit-kaur-the-princess-who-built-aiims-6570937/) from Indian Express details on how she dreamt about an institute for medical higher education in India.
  > I want this to be something wonderful, of which India can be proud, and I want India to be proud of it

She said "I want this to be something wonderful, of which India can be proud, and I want India to be proud of it," after the bill was passed in Rajya Sabha. By 1961 itself, AIIMS had attained global repute as it was placed alongside the best of institutes from America, Canada and Europe


### The companies that help people vanish

In the previous edition I mentioned about a BBC article on oldest firms of Japan. Similar to that, this too from Japan brought to us by BBC.
The Japanese being privacy centric people, they do want to vanish, sometimes. And there are firms which help them to do just that.

> In Japan, these people are sometimes referred to as “jouhatsu”. That’s the Japanese word for “evaporation”, but it also refers to people who vanish on purpose into thin air, and continue to conceal their whereabouts – potentially for years, even decades.

Read it in [BBC's Worklife](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200903-the-companies-that-help-people-vanish).


### Robots and their plan to take up writer's job

Yes, you read it write. Now robots wants to be writer, as if there is not enough reasons to worry about pink slip.

> Humans must keep doing what they have been doing, hating and fighting each other. I will sit in the background, and let them do their thing

Uhh, that's brutal. Well, we deserved some hard slap from the robots.

### China is censoring Hollywood's imagination

How come a week pass by without an interesting read on China's activity? This time the victim is Hollywood and its imagination. You can't buy creativity or imagination but you can modify it with big greenback, precisely what CCP is found to be doing.

> By censoring American blockbusters, Beijing believes it can prevent American and global audiences from imagining the Chinese Communist Party as a major threat, and from viewing the targets of China's repression as victims worthy of sympathy. - [Axios](https://www.axios.com/china-censor-hollywood-films-14d77229-b853-4e7a-8635-71191393615d.html?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter_axioschina&stream=china)

Well, in school days I thought hiding report card from my dad would help me. But a scar on my elbow says another story. Let's see how long the ploy works.


### Netflix CEO: why you shouldn't try to please your boss

In all its probability, at least among millennials, TV is dead. Thanks to Reed Hastings of Netflix. He bought in the revolution, playing a movie with a click of button, no need of additional softwares or cassettes. Won't we listen to him when he talks about the company's culture?

### If You’re So Smart, Why Aren’t You Happy?

### How a Soviet Triple Agent Recruited New Spies in the West

Who doesn't like a tale of mysterious spy? After all we all grown up watching James Bond movies.

> Safo,’ a man in his mid-fifties, worked for three different spy agencies in an extraordinary lifetime but faithfully served only one.

### Facebook returns to its roots with Campus, a college student-only social network

> Facebook will market the new app both within its app and offline. Students may be prompted to join Campus through a prompt in News Feed if Facebook has enough data to indicate they’re likely a student at a supported college. - [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/facebook-returns-to-its-roots-with-campus-a-college-student-only-social-network/?guccounter=2)

### Jeff Bezos’s Master Plan

"What does Jeff Bezos wants?". Well no one exactly knows the answers. But [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/11/what-jeff-bezos-wants/598363/) tries to answer. It's a longread. But a good one, be ready to lose some breath.
