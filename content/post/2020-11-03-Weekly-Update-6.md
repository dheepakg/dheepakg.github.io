This is the 6<sup>th</sup> instalment of weekly update. Let's revisit the interesting things that I came across in between last Monday and today (November 3, 2020). It's been a month since I updated the page. To restart the habit, I'm keeping this short to cover only the COVID stats, I'll be sharing interesting stuffs from the weekend.

Before wrapping it up lets touch on the most important event of the year. Okay, considering COVID, this is one of the *important* event of the year. The day has ended for me, but for the Americans it's a busy day - US Presidential Election 2020. We will get to know whether Trump or Biden going to prevail for next few years.
