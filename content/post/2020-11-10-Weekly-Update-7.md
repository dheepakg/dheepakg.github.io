This is the 7<sup>th</sup> instalment of weekly update. Let's revisit the interesting things that I came across in between last Monday and today (November 10, 2020). This is 444 words long.

**1. [#USElection2020](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23USElections2020)**

Joe Biden (aka [Amtrak Joe](https://railway-news.com/how-did-president-elect-biden-get-the-nickname-amtrak-joe/)) is the president-elect, winning over the incumbent Donald J Trump. It's been a huge drama right from the preparation to election till the vote counting. And, even now the counting is not over - [the Senate & the House results are awaited](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2020/nov/09/senate-and-house-elections-2020-full-results-for-congress). To be fair, the DJT's term was dramatic. Even now the President is not conceding defeat.


**2. [Vaccine is here, finally](#vaccine)**
On November 9<sup>th</sup>, Pfizer announced positive early results from its coronavirus vaccine trial, cementing the lead in a frenzied global race that has unfolded at record-breaking speed.

The firm that invented the Pfizer vaccine, Biontech, is a German medical startup founded by the children of Turkish immigrants: √ñzlem T√ºreci (CMO) and Uƒüur ≈ûahin (CEO).

The Finshots [explains](https://finshots.in/archive/pfizer-covid-vaccine/) on the developing story,
> Bear in mind, the safety data isn‚Äôt out yet and the efficacy numbers haven‚Äôt been vetted by outside researchers. In fact, we will only have additional information by the end of November.

Also,
> It proves mRNA vaccines actually work in humans. It also shows companies like Moderna who‚Äôve also been banking on the mRNA revolution, might find success with their candidate vaccines as well.


**3. [DataViz on COVID spread](#Corona_Spread)**

Headline in English edition of elapis reads [A room, a bar and a classroom: how the coronavirus is spread through the air](https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-10-28/a-room-a-bar-and-a-class-how-the-coronavirus-is-spread-through-the-air.html?utm_source=Benedict%27s+Newsletter&utm_campaign=93d8be3544-Benedict%27s+newsletter+free&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_4999ca107f-93d8be3544-71213013). The article explains how the Virus spreads in a room or bar or class room with and without ventilation.

**4. [Frecnch teacher, Blasphemy, and politics](#French_happenings)**
France is considered as epitome of free thinking. Questioning the freedom, a young Muslim beheaded a French schoolteacher who had shown caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in a class. The french security forces acted swift and cracked down on Muslim extremists. President Emmanuel Macron, a fierce defender of French secularism and the right to free speech, went as far as to suggest *that Islam was in need of an Enlightenment.*

This is not some *Uighur problem*  for Muslim states to sit and watch the proceedings. This is France, a western power. So, from Bangladesh to Turkey Muslims condemned the *"enlightment"* talks. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, went on to say ‚ÄúMacron needs mental treatment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhat is the problem of this person Macron with Muslims and Islam?‚Äù
