Last July marks the Quadrennial year working in an MNC. These years had taught me several valuable lessons. Learnt either from first-hand experience or learning from others action. What I learnt is that our fundamentals are flawed as several important things are not taught at young age.

There are  2 important things that must be included in curriculum.

[Career](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=define%20career&cad=h) vs. [Job](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=define+job&cad=h) : In earlier generation, its pride to be working with an employer for long duration (say, in terms years or decades). I have part of several farewells where in people will be treated well for part of the establishment and retiring is like a big event.  That was the day in past. I don’t come across those celebration in recent times. One of my team mate, recently joined states that this is his 5th employer in 8 years. In this 8-year-long career he has been working with several domain and several tools.

On comparing with similar person who stayed with a my employer, he is getting 30-40% more, the number is result of approx. calculation. That’s really good to have higher pay. During the course of job-hoping, he was made to work with many tools/domain. However, exposure to the individual things/domain is relatively low. Simply put he is jack of many trades. We can’t expect him to be a master.

Without specialization, after eight years is not good for his career. Yet, his job is comparatively well ahead. So, what do we need to give importance to Job or Career? We have to decide. To do so, there should be a keen awareness to differentiate and correlate.

[Wealth vs Income](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/financial-wellness/wealth-isnt-how-much-you-earn/): We are all educated to solve problems – mathematical, engineering or digital problems. But almost everyone sucks at solving financial problems.

The reason is we are not aware of the difference between income and wealth. Am I qualified to say it? Yes. I am qualified, only after reading the Rich dad Poor dad. What I am trying to convey is we are paid a hefty amount and we think ourselves good enough of the fat check. Income is the one that you work for and wealth is the one that works for you. We ignore the wealth, we end-up bankrupt any day. But in reality, many of my colleagues (of my age group) considers investment as an overhead. Their argument is “I am getting paid. Why to think about distant future”. I will say this is an ignorance at its best.

Power comes with responsibility. Power – income; Responsibility – Investment/wealth generation. We miss larger picture by focusing on smaller things. Career & wealth accumulation are major things that needs to be concentrated for long run. But from schooling to graduation our education system keeps us unaware of the both.

Then, how to neutralize the flaws in education system? Simple. Self-learning. But what and how should we be self-taught. How to get a picture of what is missed out? Answer is getting exposure through necessary means – books, Internet and/or listening to elders. Disappointingly, we consider way above the elders and their suggestions on life. Reading books is so uncool. Internet consists of couple of sites – Facebook, YouTube and Gmail.

God save this generation.
