**Variables**

In **Python**, the variables are assigned with the type based on the content.

```python
string_variable = 'some text'
int_variable = 33
print(type(string_variable), type(int_variable))
```

And, these variables are allowed to change in a program.

In **Rust**, the variables can either be mutable or immutable. By default, the variables are immutable.
> Mutable - Values are allowed to change
> Immutable - Values are not allowed to change

```Rust

fn main() {
let default_variable = 2;
println!("The value in default_variable is {}",{default_variable});

default_variable = 3;
//Here, the code will fail.
//Because we tried to modify the immutable variable

println!("The new value in default_variable is {}",{default_variable});

}

```

This is where **Shadowing** comes into picture.

When we employ `let`, the variable's values can be rebound to the new value.
```Rust
fn main() {
let default_variable = 2;
println!("The value in default_variable is {}",{default_variable});
let default_variable = 3;
//we used 'let' above line to rebound the variable to new values
println!("The new value in default_variable is {}",{default_variable});

let mut new_variable = 23;
println!("new_variable is {}", {new_variable});
new_variable = new_variable * 2;
//Here, the variable is mutable. And so, the variable can be modified
println!("new_variable is {}",{new_variable})
}

```

Concluding the variables section.
* Variables, by default are immutable (can't unbind its value).
* Using Shadowing technique we *can* modify the immutable variables using keyword `let immutable_variable = some_other_value`
* Also, we can declare a variable mutable as `let mut variable_name`
