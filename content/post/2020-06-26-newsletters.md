Emails became so much intertwined in our daily life. Whatever the internet service it be, eventually it comes to identifying you only through your email<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>.
The newsletters used to be my source of information. I gradually unsubscribed to newsletters and marked the providers as important in my everyday feed of Twitter & Facebook.

There is a couple of first order effects,
1. I inadvertently started following so many users related to the news feeds
2. The email inbox, once used to be zero inbox turned out to be filled with spams and filths

Beyond First Order<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>

 1. Started losing time in aimless scrolling of social media.
 2. Missed to read important emails
 3. The phone addiction becomes a thing

Thanks to one of the tweet thread, I started subscribing to newsletters. But the problem is cluttered inbox. Took a half day to cleanup my inbox, unsubscribed umpteen emails, turned off facebook's 'birthday wishes' emails.

It's been over a month of reading newsletters. I feel satisfied with this new habit of going through emails in the mornings instead of scrolling my news feed.

Also, on every morning, my inbox becomes zero.

I'll list down my newsletter in another post.
