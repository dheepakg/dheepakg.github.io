Let's revisit the interesting things that I came across in between last Monday and today (August 30, 2020).


#### Positive News
  1. Apart from recoveries, I don't see any positive news in the last week.
  As of 29<sup>th</sup>, the number of recovery is 2.712M, with total cases at 3.539M. Recovery rate @ 75+

#### Negative News
  1. As if the COVID-19 pandemic is not enough, the state of Assam is worst affected by flood in Brahmaputra river.
      > By 21st of July, the meteorological subdivision of Assam and Meghalaya had received rainfall of 1,164mm as compared to normal rainfall of 894mm during the period, an excess of nearly 30%. - [IMD](http://hydro.imd.gov.in/hydrometweb/(S(wgwle03sv254qwjoq1ytto45))/PdfPageImage.aspx?imgUrl=PRODUCTS\Rainfall_Maps\Cumulative\Subdivision_Rainfall_Map\SUBDIVISION_RAINFALL_MAP_COUNTRY_INDIA_cd.JPG&landingpage=landing)
  2. The Daily new COVID-19 cases has been consistently staying above 70K. The last 3 days are listed below,
      * August 29: 78,479
      * August 28: 76,657
      * August 27: 76,827
      _Sad fact: As of today, India is having highest number of new cases._

  3. 39 Dolphins had washed up dead on the beaches of Mauritius is revealing to be another grim story. Thanks to the oil spill from a container ship.
      * The culprit ship belongs to Japan with Panama's flag and captained by an Indian.
      * This turning out to be biggest environmental issue of the year, yet.
