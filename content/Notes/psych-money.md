The book is crisp - 240 pages grouped into 20 chapters, each having few stories to explain actions behind money decisions.

## Notes from each of the chapter

### Introduction

- A genius who loses control of their emotions can be a financial disaster.
- Financial success is not a hard science. It's a soft skill.
- Physics isn't controversial; it's guided by laws. Finance is different; it's guided by human behaviours.
- To grasp why people bury themselves in debt you don't need to study interest rates; you need to study the history of greed, insecurity and optimism.

### 1. No One's Crazy

> Your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.0000001% of what's happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.

- Everyone has their own unique experience with how the world works.
- "Some lessons have to be experienced before they can be understood" - Michael Batnick
- "Our findings suggest that individual investors' willingness to bear risk depends on personal history." - The Economist
- "To rephrase an old saying: everyone talks about retirement, but apparently very few do anything about it" - NYT
- _No one is crazy_ - we all make decisions based on our own unique experiences that seems to make sense to us in a given moment.

### 2. Luck & Risk

> Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.

- _Luck and Risk_ are siblings. They are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort.
- The line between "inspiringly bold" and "foolishly reckless" can be a millimetre thick and only visible with hindsight.
- Risk and Luck are doppelgÃ¤ngers.
- Be careful who you praise and admire. Careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming.
- Focus less on specific individuals and case studies and more on broad patterns.

### 3. Never Enough

> When rich people do crazy things.

- _Enough_ - it's so smart , and so powerful.
- "_they already had everything: unimaginable wealth, prestige, power, freedom. And threw it all away because they wanted more_" - on [Bernie Madoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madoff_investment_scandal) and [Rajat Gupta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raj_Rajaratnam/Galleon_Group,_Anil_Kumar,_and_Rajat_Gupta_insider_trading_cases).
- "If you risk something that is important to you for something that is unimportant to you, it just does not make any sense" - Warren Buffet.
- Modern capitalism is pro at two things - generating wealth and generating envy.
- Happiness = Result - Expectations
- The ceiling of social comparison is so high that virtually no one will ever hit it.

### 4. Confounding Compounding

> $81.5 billion of Warren Buffett's $84.5 billion net worth came after his 65th birthday. Our minds are not built to handle such absurdities.

- Lessons from one field can often teach us something important about unrelated fields
- "_His skill is investing; his secret is time_" - on Warren Buffett
- Good investing is about earning pretty good returns that you can stick with and which can be repeated for the longest period of time. That's when compounding runs wild.
- If you were a technology optimist in the 1950s you may have predicted that practical storage would become 1000 times or 10,000 times larger. Few would have said _30 million_ times larger within lifetime. But, thats what happened.

### 5. Getting Wealthy vs. Staying Wealthy

> Good investing is not necessarily about making good decisions. It's about consistently not screwing up.

- There are million ways to get wealthy, and plenty of books on how to do so. But there's only one way to stay wealthy; some combination of frugality and paranoia.
- Compunding only grows if you can give an asset years and years to grow.
- Planning is important, but the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan.
- A plan is only useful if it can survive reality. And a future filled with unknowns is everyone's reality.
- Destruction in the face of progress is not only possible, but an efficient way to get rid of excess.
- You need short-term paranoia to keep you alive long enough to exploit long-term optimism.

### 6. Tails, You Win

> You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune.

- "I've been banging away at this thing for 30 years. I think the simple math is, some projects works and some don't. There's no reason to belabour either one. Just get on to next." - Brad Pitt accepting Screen Actors Guild Award

- The idea that few things account for most results is not just true for companies in your investment portfolio. It's also an important part of your own behaviour as an investor.
- Good definition of investing genius is one who can do the average thing when all those around them are going crazy.
- The fact that you can read this book is the result of the longest tail you can imagine.

### 7. Freedom

> Controlling your time is the highest dividend money pays

- The ability to do _what you want, when you want, with who you want, for as long as you want,_ is priceless. It is the highest dividend money pays.

- Doing something you love on a schedule you can't control can feel the same _as doing something that you hate_
- "If the operating equipment of the 21<sup>st</sup> century is a portable device, this means the modern factory is not a place at all. _The factory is the day itself._" - Derek Thomson of The Atlantic.

### 8. Man in the Car Paradox

> No one is impressed with your possessions as much as you are.

- Humility, Kindness, and empathy will bring you more respect than horsepower ever will.

### 9. Wealth is What You Don't See

> Spending money to show peopple how mush money you have is the fastest way to have less money

- Rich is current income. But _wealth_ is hidden. _It's income that's not spent_.
- People are good at learning by imitation. But the hidden nature of wealth makes it hard to imitate others and learn their ways.

### 10. Save Money

> The only factor you can control generates one of the only things that matters.

- The value of wealth is relative to what you need.
- Only saving for a specific goal makes sense is a predictable world. _But ours isn't always predictable_.
- Past a certain level is income, what you need is just what sits below your ego.
- People's ability to save is more in their control than they might think.
- Flexibility and control over your time is an unseen return on wealth.

### 11. Reasonable > Rational

> Aiming to be mostly reasonable works better than trying to be coldly rational.

- It may be rational to want a fever if you have an infection. But its not reasonable.

### 12. Suprise!

> History is the study of change, ironically used as a map of the future.

- You'll likely miss the outlier events that move the needle the most.
- The majority of what's happening at any given moment in the global economy can be tied back to a handful of past events that were nearly impossible to predict.

- History can be misleading guide to the future of the economy or stock market.
- Historians are not prophets.

### 13. Room for Error

> The most important part of every plan is planning on your plan not going according to plan.

- The wisdom is having room for error is acknowledging that uncertainty, randomness, and chance are an ever present part of life.
- The purpose of having _Margin of safety_ is to render the forecast unnecessary.

- Room of error lets you endure a range of potential outcomes and endurance lets you stick around long enough to let the odds of benefitting from low-probablity outcome fall in your favour.
- Having a gap between what you can technically endure versus what's emotionally possible is an overlooked version of room for error.
- IF something has 95% odds of being right, the 5% odds of being wrong means you will almost certainly experience the downside at some point in your life.

- A homeowner wiped out in 2009 had no chance of taking advantage of cheap mortage rates in 2010.
- A good rule of thumb - That everything that can break will eventually break.

### 14. You'll Change

> Long-term planning is harder that it seems because people's goals and desires change over time.

- An underpinning of psychology is that people are poor forecasters of their future selves.

- We should avoid extreme end of financial planning.
- We should also come to accept the reality of changing our minds.
- Sunk cost - Anchoring decisions to past efforts that can't be refunded.
- Financial goals made when you were a different person should be abandoned without mercy versus put on life support and dragged on can be a good strategy to minimize future regrets.

### 15. Nothing's Free

> Everything has a price, but not all prices appear on labels.

- Every job looks easy when you're not the one doing it.
- In Investing _volatality_ is always a fee, not a fine.

### 16. You & Me

> Beware taking financial cues from people playing different game than you are.

- Bubbles form when the momentum of short-term returns attracts enough money that the makeup of investors shifts from mostly long term to mostly short term.

- A young lawyer aiming to be a partner at a prestigious law firm might need to maintain an appearance that I, a writer who can work in sweatpants, have no need for.

### 17. The Seduction of Pessimism

> Optimism sounds like a sales pitch. Pessimism sounds like someone trying to help you

- Optimism is a belief that odds of a good outcome are in your favour over time, even when there will be setbacks along the way.
- "For reasons I have never understand, people like to hear that the world is going to hell" - Historian Deirdre McCloskey

- Pessimism sounds smarter and more plausible than Optimism.
- There are 2 topics that will affect your life whether you're interested in them or not: Money & Health.
- Pessimists often extrapolate present trends without accounting for how markets adapt.

- Iron law in Economics - Extremely good and extremely bad circumstances rarely stay that way for long because _supply and demand adapt in hard-to-predict ways_.

- The progress happen too slowly to notice. But setbacks happen too quickly to ignore
- Growth is driven by compounding, which always takes time. Destruction is driven by single point of failure, which can happen in seconds and loss of confidence which can happen in an instant.

- Pessimism reduces expectations, narrowing the gap between possible outcomes and outcomes you feel great about.
- Expecting things to be bad is the best way to be pleasantly surprised.

### 18. When You'll Believe Anything

> Appealing fictions, and why stories more powerful that statistics.

- The more you want something to be true, the more likely you are to believe a story that overestimates the odds of it being true.
- Investing is one of the only field that offers daily opportunities for extreme rewards.
- Incentives are a powerful motivators, and we should always remember how they influence our own financial goals and outlooks.

- Everyone has an incomplete view of the world. But we form a complete narrative to fill the gaps.
- Risk is what's left when you think you've thought of everything.

### 20. Confessions

> The psychology of my own money.

- Independence, to me, doesn't mean you'll stop working. It means you only do the work you like with people you like at the times you want for as long as you want.

- True success is exiting some rat race to modulate one's activities for peace of mind.
- Good decisions aren't always rational. At some point you have to choose between being happy or being 'right'.

- Everyone will face a huge expense they did not expect - and they don't plan for these expenses specifically because they did not expect them.

- The 1<sup>st</sup> rule of compounding is to never interrupt is unnecessarily.

- Every investor should pick a strategy that has highest probability of successfully meeting their goals.

- I can afford to not be the greatest investor in the world; but I can't afford to be a bad investor.

## Conclusion
