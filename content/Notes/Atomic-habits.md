**Notes from each of the chapter**

## Introduction

**How I learnt about Habits**

- A habit is a routine or behaviour that is performed regularly - and in many cases, automatically.

- Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you're willing to stick with them for year.

**How this book will benefit you?**

> "To write a great book, you must first become a book", says Naval Ravikant

- Backbone of this book is four step model of habits **Cue, Craving, Response and Rewards**

- Human behaviour is always changing: situation to situation, moment to moment, second to second. This book is about what _doesn't_ change.

## Fundamentals

> Why tiny changes make a big differences

### 1 The Surprising power of habits

- **Aggregation marginal gain** - The philosophy searching for a tiny marginal improvement in everything we do.
- Improving by 1 percent isn't particularly notable - sometimes it isn't even noticeable - but it can be far more meaningful, especially in long term.

- What starts as small win or minor setback accumulates into something much more.
- Habits are the compound interest of self improvement.
- **Success** is a product of daily habits - not once in a lifetime transformation.

- If you're broke, but you save a little bit every month, then you're on the path toward financial freedom - even if you're moving slower that you'd like.

- Your outcomes are a lagging measures of your habits.

- Tiny magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.

- Habits are double-edged sword. BAd habits can cut you down just as easily as good habits can build you up, which is why understanding details is crucial.

#### What progress is really like?

- Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. This pattern shows up everywhere.

- Habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance.

- The most powerful outcomes are delayed.
- In order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through - this the author call as _Plateau of latent Potential_.

- Our work is not wasted; it is just being stored.

- Change can take years - before it happen all at once.

- Mastery requires patience.

- All big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision.

#### Forget about goals, Focus on systems instead

- Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.

- Goals are good for direction, but system are best for making progress.

#### Problem 1: Winners are losers have the same goals

- The goal had always been there. It was only when they implemented a system of continuous small improvements that they achieve a different outcome .

#### Problem 2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change

- Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That's the counterintuitive thing about improvement.

- Fix the inputs; output will fix themselves.

#### Problem 3: Goals restrict your happiness

- Goals create a 'either-or' conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment.

- A systems-first mentality provides the antidote.

- When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don't have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy.

#### Problem 4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress

- When all of your hard work is focussed on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people reverting back to the old habits after accomplishing a goal.

- The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.

- Ultimately, it is our commitment to the process that will determine our progress.

#### A system of Atomic Habits

- Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because we don't want to change, but because we have wrong system for change.

- We do not rise to the level of our goals. We fall to the level of our systems.

### 2 How your habits shape your identity (and vice versa)

Changing our habits is challenging for 2 reasons

1. We try to change wrong thing
2. We try to change our habits in the wrong way
