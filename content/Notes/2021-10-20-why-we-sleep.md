During an interview in my early days of career HR asked me how I manage day-to-day pressure that I face. I answered that I'll doze off and manage to move on from previous day's not-so-pleasant events. I told this anecdote whenever someone makes fun of my sleepiness. Lo and behold this book shone light on events happening inside the cranium while we sleep, and states that we do able to handle emotions and bad memories through good night's sleep.

## Caffeine, Jet Lag and Melatonin

1. An adult's owlness or larkness, also known as their chronotype is strongly determined by genetics.

2. Our 24-hour circadian rhythm determines wake and sleep cycle.

3. While we are awake, a chemical called _adenosine_ gets built up in our brain. It'll continue to increase in concentration with every single waking minute. One consequence of increasing adenosine in the brain is an increasing desire to sleep.

4. Caffeine - artificially mute sleep signal of adenosine, by making us more alert and awake.

5. Caffeine is second most traded commodity after _oil_. It is widely used as psychoactive stimulant in the world.

6. Caffeine works by successfully battling with _adenosine_ for the privilege of latching on to adenosine receptors. Caffeine inactivates receptors, acting as a masking agent. It's equivalent of sticking our fingers in your ears to shut out a sound.

7. Caffeine has an average half-life of five to seven hours. _Half-life_ refers to length of time it takes for the body to remove 50% of drug's concentration.

## Defining and Generating Sleep

8. NREM sleep - Non-rapid Eye Movement sleep; REM sleep - Rapid Eye Movement

9. NREM sleep - Dominates early in night. Weeds out and removes unnecessary neural connection. Helps transfer and makes safe newly learned information into long-term storage.

10. REM sleep - Prevails later in night. Dreaming stage. Strengthens connections between neurons. Collides freshly minted memories with entire back catalog of our life's autobiography.

11. If you wake up earlier, you compromise REM sleep - forming memory will be impacted.

12. If you sleep late at night, it affects NREM sleep - getting rid of toxins/unnecessary neural connection gets impacted.

13. Evolution outlaws muscle activity during REM sleep - thereby prevents acting out on our dream experience.

## Ape Beds, Dinosaurs, and Napping with Half Brain

14. Its discovered that very simplest forms of unicellular organisms that survive for periods exceeding 24 hours, such as bacteria, have active and passive phases that correspond to the light-dark cycle of our planet. It is believed this is precursor of our own circadian rhythm.

15. Non-dreaming stage - NREM is being experienced by every species.

16. Sleep deprivation - Sleep duration is far longer on the recovery night than a standard night without sleep deprivation.

17. The brain will consume a far larger portion of deep NREM sleep than REM sleep on the first night after sleep deprivation.

18. If you sleep in unfamiliar environment, one half of brain sleeps a little lighter than the other, as if it's standing guard with just a tad more vigilance due to potentially less safe context that the conscious brain has registered while awake.

19. Siesta - An afternoon rest/nap, one taken during hottest hours of the day in a hot climate.

20. Biphasic sleep is observed in several cultures throughout the world.

21. Time we spend asleep is markedly shorter than all other primates. Between 20 - 25 percent of our sleep time is dedicated to REM sleep dreaming compared to an average of only 9 percent across all other primates.

22. REM - Creates mnemonic collisions during REM sleep spark new creative insights as novel links are forged between unrelated pieces of information.

## Changes in sleep across the life span

23. Prior to birth, and soon after, the challenge for development was to build and add vast number of neural highways and interconnections that become a fledgling brain. So, the REM sleep dominates the sleep.

24. During late childhood and adolescence, the goal is to rewire the connections for effectiveness and efficiency. NREM sleep gets equal importance during this phase.

25. One of the primary activity of NREM is to synaptic pruning, very prominent in adolescent period. This results in adolescents have a less rational version of an adult brain, one that takes more risks and has relatively poor decision making skills.

26. Older adults needs lesser sleep is a _myth_.

27. The part of brain that ignite healthy deep sleep at night are the very same areas that degenerate earliest as we age.

## Your Mother and Shakespeare Knew

28. Sleep is not the absence of wakefulness, it is far more than that.

29. Sleep before learning refreshes our ability to initially make new memories, it does so each and every night.

30. Sleeping after learning helps memory to click 'save' button.

31. After full night's sleep, brain fetches information from neocortex - region that serves as the long-term storage site.

32. Even daytime naps (as short as 20 mins) can offer a memory consolidation advantage, so long as they contain enough NREM sleep.

33. _Inemuri_ - a Japanese term for unintentional public napping.

34. Sleep was far more intelligent than we previously thought. Sleep is able to offer a far more discerning hand in memory improvement: one that preferentially picks and chooses what information is, and in not, ultimately strengthened.

35. REM sleep presents us with outlandish memory blending.

## Too Extreme for the Guinness Book of World Records

36. The momentary lapse in concentration due to sleep deprivation is termed as _microsleep_. During microsleep, our brain becomes blind to the outside world for brief moment - not just visual domain, but in all channels of perception.

37. We do not know how sleep-deprived we are when we are sleep-deprived.

38. After 16 hours of being awake, the brain begins to fail. Human needs more than seven hours of sleep each night to maintain cognitive performance.

39. Drunk drivers are late to apply brake; but when sleep deprived, microsleep sets in and we lose ability to react altogether.

40. Without sleep we lose ability to balance emotional impulse(anygdala) and rationality(prefrontal cortex).

41. > The best bridge between despair and hope is a good night's sleep - E. Joseph Cossman, American entrepreneur.

42. Alzheimer's disease is associated with the buildup of a toxic form of protein called beta-amyloid, which aggregates in sticky clumps or plaques within the brain. Amyloid plaques are poisonous to neurons, killing the surrounding brain cells.

## Cancer, Heart Attacks and a Shorter Life

43. In a healthy individual, the hormone insulin will trigger the cells of your body to swiftly absorb glucose from the bloodstream should it increase, as happens after eating a meal. Instructed by insulin, the cells of your body will open special channels on their surface that operate like wonderfully efficient roadside drains at the height of a downpour. They have no problem dealing with the deluge of glucose coursing down the transit arteries, avert ing what could otherwise be a dangerous flood of sugar in the bloodstream.

44. From a metabolic perspective, the sleep-restricted participants had lost their hunger control. By limiting these individuals to what some in our society would think of as a "sufficient" amount of sleep (five hours a night), Van Cauter had caused a profound imbalance in the scales of hormonal food desire. By muting the chemical message that says "stop eating" (leptin), yet increasing the hormonal voice that shouts "please keep eating" , your appetite remains unsatisfied when you sleep is anything less than plentiful, even after a kingly meal. As Va Cauter has elegantly described to me, a sleep-deprived body will c famine in the midst of plenty.

## Dreaming as Overnight Therapy

45. Perhaps it was not the time that heals all wounds, but rather time spent in dream sleep.

46. We can accurately relive the memory but we do not experience the same visceral reaction that was present and imprinted at the time of the episode.

47. If the brain cannot divorce the emotion from memory across the first night following a trauma experience, the theory suggests that a repeat attempt of emotional memory stripping will occur on the second night, as the strength of "emotional tag" associated with memory remains too high.
    If the process fails second time, the same attempt will continue to repeat the next night, and the next night, like a broken record.
    This was precisely what appeared to be happening with recurring nightmares of the trauma experience in PTSD patients.

48. Reality and perceived reality were no longer same in the "eyes" of the sleepless brain.

## Dream Creativity and Dream Control

49. Deep NREM sleep strengthens individual memories, as we know. But, it is REM sleep that offers the masterful and complementary benefit of fusing and blending those elemental ingredients together.

## Things that go bump in the night

50. People suffering from the insomnia therefore cannot produce sufficient sleep quantity/quality, even though they give themselves enough time to do do.

51. Staying away from something that would feel bad, or trying to accomplish something that would feel good. This law of approach and avoidance dictates most of the human and animal behavior from very early age.

## iPads, Factory, Whistles and Nightcaps

52. Using snooze feature means that we will repeatedly inflict that cardiovascular assault again and again within a short span of time.

## Hurting and Helping your sleep

53. Sleeping pills do not provide natural sleep, can damage health and increase the risk of life-threatening diseases.

54. The ways to sleep better,

55. Reducing caffeine and coffee intake
56. Removing screen technology from the bedroom, and
57. having a cool bedroom

58. Establish regular bed time and wake-up time
59. Go to bed only when sleepy, avoid sleeping on the couch early/mid evenings
60. Never lie awake on the bed for significant time
61. Avoid napping if you're struggling to sleep at night
62. Reduce anxiety provoking thoughts and worries by learning to mentally decelerate before bed
63. Remove visible clock faces from the view in the bedroom, preventing clock-watching anxiety.

## Sleep and Society

55. The brain can never recover all the sleep it has been deprived of. We cannot accumulate a debt without penalty, nor can we repay that sleep debt at a later time.

56. Under-slept employees are more likely to blame other people in the workplace for their own mistakes and even try to take credit for other people's successful work; hardly a recipe for team building.

57. Sleepy employees chose the more selfish path of least resistance when working in teams, coasting on the disingenuous ticket of social loafing.

58. REM sleeps is what stand between _rationality_ and _insanity_.

59. In `Genetic Studies of Genius`, Dr. Lewis Terman found that no matter what the age, the longer a child slept, the more intellectually gifted they were.

## A New Vision for Sleep in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century

60. Accepting that our lack of sleep is a slow form of self-euthanasia.
