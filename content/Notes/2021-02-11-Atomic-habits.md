**Notes from each of the chapter**

## Introduction

**How I learnt about Habits**

- A habit is a routine or behaviour that is performed regularly - and in many cases, automatically.

- Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you're willing to stick with them for year.

**How this book will benefit you?**

> "To write a great book, you must first become a book", says Naval Ravikant

- Backbone of this book is four step model of habits **Cue, Craving, Response and Rewards**

- Human behaviour is always changing: situation to situation, moment to moment, second to second. This book is about what _doesn't_ change.

## Fundamentals

> Why tiny changes make a big differences

### 1 The Surprising power of habits

- **Aggregation marginal gain** - The philosophy searching for a tiny marginal improvement in everything we do.
- Improving by 1 percent isn't particularly notable - sometimes it isn't even noticeable - but it can be far more meaningful, especially in long term.

- What starts as small win or minor setback accumulates into something much more.
- Habits are the compound interest of self improvement.
- **Success** is a product of daily habits - not once in a lifetime transformation.

- If you're broke, but you save a little bit every month, then you're on the path toward financial freedom - even if you're moving slower that you'd like.

- Your outcomes are a lagging measures of your habits.

- Tiny magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.

- Habits are double-edged sword. BAd habits can cut you down just as easily as good habits can build you up, which is why understanding details is crucial.

#### What progress is really like?

- Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. This pattern shows up everywhere.

- Habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance.

- The most powerful outcomes are delayed.
- In order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through - this the author call as _Plateau of latent Potential_.

- Our work is not wasted; it is just being stored.

- Change can take years - before it happen all at once.

- Mastery requires patience.

- All big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision.

#### Forget about goals, Focus on systems instead

- Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.

- Goals are good for direction, but system are best for making progress.

#### Problem 1: Winners are losers have the same goals

- The goal had always been there. It was only when they implemented a system of continuous small improvements that they achieve a different outcome.

#### Problem 2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change

- Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That's the counterintuitive thing about improvement.

- Fix the inputs; output will fix themselves.

#### Problem 3: Goals restrict your happiness

- Goals create a 'either-or' conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment.

- A systems-first mentality provides the antidote.

- When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don't have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy.

#### Problem 4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress

- When all of your hard work is focussed on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people reverting back to the old habits after accomplishing a goal.

- The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.

- Ultimately, it is our commitment to the process that will determine our progress.

#### A system of Atomic Habits

- Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because we don't want to change, but because we have wrong system for change.

- We do not rise to the level of our goals. We fall to the level of our systems.

### 2 How your habits shape your identity (and vice versa)

Changing our habits is challenging for 2 reasons

1. We try to change wrong thing
2. We try to change our habits in the wrong way

|                                                      Three Layers of Behaviour Change                                                      |

1. First layer is changing your outcomes
   - The goals you set are associated with this level
2. The Second layer is changing your process
   - Most of the habits you build are associated with this level
3. The Third and deepest layer is changing your identity
   - Most of the beliefs assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level.

- Outcomes are about what you get.
- Processes are about what you do.
- Identity is about what you believe

**Outcome-based and Identity-based Habits**

- **Focussing on what we want to achieve** leads to outcome-based habits.
- **Focussing on who we wish to become** leads to identity-based habits.

- People don't even consider identity change when they set out to improve
- Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs.

- The **ultimate** form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of our identity.

- Once our pride gets involved, we'll fight tooth and nail to maintain our habits.

- Improvements are only temporary until we become part of who we are.

- Good habits can make rational sense, but if we conflict with our identity, we will fail to put them into action.

- Becoming the best version of ourself requires us to continuously edit our beliefs, and to upgrade and expand our identity.

**The 2-step process to changing our IDENTITY**

- Our identity is literally our "repeated beingness".
- The effect of one-off experience tends to fade away while the effect of habits gets reinforced with time.
- The process of building habits is actually the process of becoming ourself.

- Every action we take is a vote for the type of person we wish to become.

- The most practical way to change who we are is to change what we do.

- Our habits shape our identity, and our identity shapes our habits, a two-way street.

**The real reasons habits matter**

- Identity change is North Star of habit change.
- We have the power to change our beliefs about ourself. Our identity is not set in stone.
- Eventually, we become our habits.

### 3 How to build better habits in 4 simple steps.

#### Why your brain builds habits

- The process of habit formation begins with trial and error.
- We're taking in tons of new information and trying to make sense of it all. The brain is busy learning the most effective course of action.

- After we stumble upon an unexpected reward, we alter our strategy for next time. Our brain immediatele begins to catalog the events that preceded the reward. _Wait a minute - that feels good. What did I do right before that?_
- Feedback loop of human behaviour - Try, Fail, Learn, Try Differently.

- Habits are simple reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.
- As habits are created, the level in the brain decreases.
- The primary reason the brain remembers the past is to better predict what will work in the future.
- Habit formation is incredible useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain.
- Habits do not restrict freedom, they create it.

- **When we have our habits dialed in and the basics of life are handled and done, our mind is free to focus on new challenges and master the next set of problems. Building habits in the present allows us to do more of what we want in the future.**

#### The Science Of Now Habits Work

- Cue: are meaningless until they are interpreted
- Craving: is the thoughts, feeling, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue
- Response: is the actual habit we perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action
- Reward: is delivered by the response

We chase rewards because they serve 2 purposes

1.  They satisfy us
2.  They teach us
