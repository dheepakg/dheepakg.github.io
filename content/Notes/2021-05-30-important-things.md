### Second-level thinking

1. Successful investing requires thoughtful attention to many separate aspects, all at the same time.
2. There’s no surefire recipe for investment success.
3. “Experience is what you got when you didn’t get what you wanted.”

4. In short, being right may be a necessary condition for investment success, but it won’t be sufficient.

5. First-level thinkers look for simple formulas and easy answers. Second-level thinkers know that success in investing is the antithesis of simple.

6. To outperform the average investor, you have to be able to outthink the consensus.

7. Mutual funds are rated relative to each other. The ratings don’t say anything about their having beaten an objective standard such as a market index.

### Understanding market efficiency (and its limitations)

8. if riskier investments could be counted on to produce higher returns, they wouldn’t be riskier.
9. Inefficient markets do not necessarily give their participants generous returns.

10. For every person who gets a good buy in an inefficient market, someone else sells too cheap.

11. Something else to keep in mind: just because efficiencies exist today doesn’t mean they’ll remain forever.

12. Inefficiency is a necessary condition for superior investing.
13. Abstention on the part of those who won’t venture in creates opportunities for those who will.

### Value

14. The random walk hypothesis says a stock’s past price movements are of absolutely no help in predicting future movements. In other words, it’s a random process, like tossing a coin. We all know that even if a coin has come up heads ten times in a row, the probability of heads on the next throw is still fifty-fifty.
15. Momentum investing might enable you to participate in a bull market that continues upward, but I see a lot of drawbacks. One is based on economist Herb Stein’s wry observation that “if something cannot go on forever, it will stop.”
16. The way I see it, day traders considered themselves successful if they bought a stock at $10 and sold at $11, bought it back the next week at $24 and sold at $25, and bought it a week later at $39 and sold at $40. If you can’t see the flaw in this—that the trader made $3 in a stock that appreciated by $30—you probably shouldn’t read the rest of this book.

17. To value investors, an asset isn’t an ephemeral concept you invest in because you think it’s attractive (or think others will find it attractive). It’s a tangible object that should have an intrinsic value capable of being ascertained, and if it can be bought below its intrinsic value, you might consider doing so. Thus, intelligent investing has to be built on estimates of intrinsic value. Those estimates must be derived rigorously, based on all of the available information.

18. The primary goal of value investors, then, is to quantify the company’s current value and buy its securities when they can do so cheaply.

19. One of the greatest investment adages reminds us, “Being too far ahead of your time is indistinguishable from being wrong.”

20. An accurate opinion on valuation, loosely held, will be of limited help. An incorrect opinion on valuation, strongly held, is far worse. This one statement shows how hard it is to get it all right.

21. Thus, there are two essential ingredients for profit in a declining market: you have to have a view on intrinsic value, and you have to hold that view strongly enough to be able to hang in and buy even as price declines suggest that you’re wrong. Oh yes, there’s a third: you have to be right.

### The relationship between price and value

22. Investment success doesn’t come from “buying good things,” but rather from “buying things well.”
23. It has been demonstrated time and time again that no asset is so good that it can’t become a bad investment if bought at too high a price.

24. Two examples: the forced selling that takes place when market crashes cause levered investors to receive margin calls and be sold out, and the inflows of cash to mutual funds that require portfolio managers to buy.

25. There’s nothing better than buying from someone who has to sell regardless of price during a crash.

26. The discipline that is most important is not accounting or economics, but psychology.

27. Investing is a popularity contest, and the most dangerous thing is to buy something at the peak of its popularity. At that point, all favorable facts and opinions are already factored into its price, and no new buyers are left to emerge.

28. The safest and most potentially profitable thing is to buy something when no one likes it. Given time, its popularity, and thus its price, can only go one way: up.

29. “It’s not cheap, but I think it’ll keep going up because of excess liquidity” (or any number of other reasons).

30. “The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.”

### Understanding risk

31. "Risk means more things can happen than will happen" - Elroy Dimson

32. Investing consists of exactly one thing: dealing with the future. And because none of us can know the future with certainty, risk is inescapable.

33. Riskier investments are those for which the outcome is less certain.

34. According to the academicians who developed capital market theory, risk equals volatility, because volatility indicates the unreliability of an investment.

35. The fact that something didn’t happen doesn’t mean it was unlikely.

36. It’s impossible to assess the accuracy of probability estimates other than 0 and 100 except over a very large number of trials.

37. “There’s a big difference between probability and outcome. Probable things fail to happen— and improbable things happen— all the time.”

### Recognizing risk

38. No matter how good fundamentals may be, humans exercising their greed and propensity to err have the ability to screw things up.

39. Risk means uncertainty about which outcome will occur and about the possibility of loss when the unfavorable ones do.

40. Risk is incredibly important to investors. It’s also ephemeral and unmeasurable. All of this makes it very hard to recognize, especially when emotions are running high. But recognize it we must.

41. Broad consensus that something’s too hot to handle is almost always wrong. Usually it’s the opposite that’s true.

42. I’m firmly convinced that investment risk resides most where it is least perceived,

43. When everyone believes something is risky, their unwillingness to buy usually reduces its price to the point where it’s not risky at all. Broadly negative opinion can make it the least risky thing, since all optimism has been driven out of its price.

44. High quality assets can be risky, and low quality assets can be safe. It’s just a matter of the price paid for them. .

### Controlling risk

45. Great investors are those who take risks that are less than commensurate with the returns they earn. They may produce moderate returns with low risk, or high returns with moderate risk.

46. Risk—the possibility of loss—is not observable. What is observable is loss, and loss generally happens only when risk collides with negative events.

47. Germs cause illness, but germs themselves are not illness. (analogy to risk)

48. Controlling the risk in your portfolio is a very important and worthwhile pursuit. The fruits, however, come only in the form of losses that don’t happen. Such what-if calculations are difficult in placid times.

49. Extreme volatility and loss surface only infrequently. And as time passes without that happening, it appears more and more likely that it’ll never happen— that assumptions regarding risk were too conservative. Thus, it becomes tempting to relax rules and increase leverage. And often this is done just before the risk finally rears its head.

50. Risk control is the best route to loss avoidance. Risk avoidance, on the other hand, is likely to lead to return avoidance as well.

51. Skillful risk control is the mark of the superior investor.

### Being attentive to cycles

52. In investing, as in life, there are very few sure things. Values can evaporate, estimates can be wrong, circumstances can change and “sure things” can fail.

53. There are two concepts we can hold to with confidence: Rule number one: most things will prove to be cyclical. Rule number two: some of the greatest opportunities for gain and loss come when other people forget rule number one.

54. The basic reason for the cyclicality in our world is the involvement of humans.

55. Success carries within itself the seeds of failure, and failure the seeds of success.

56. In the financial world, if you offer cheap money, they will borrow, buy and build— often without discipline, and with very negative consequences.

### Awareness of the pendulum

56. When things are going well and prices are high, investors rush to buy, forgetting all prudence. Then, when there’s chaos all around and assets are on the bargain counter, they lose all willingness to bear risk and rush to sell. And it will ever be so.

57. The old adage “What the wise man does in the beginning, the fool does in the end.”

58. There are a few things of which we can be sure, and this is one: Extreme market behavior will reverse.

### Combating negative influences

59. The desire for more, the fear of missing out, the tendency to compare against others, the influence of the crowd and the dream of the sure thing—these factors are near universal.

60. Inefficiencies—mispricings, misperceptions, mistakes that other people make—provide potential opportunities for superior performance.

61. The biggest investing errors come not from factors that are informational or analytical, but from those that are psychological.

62. Greed is an extremely powerful force. It’s strong enough to overcome common sense, risk aversion, prudence, caution, logic, memory of painful past lessons, resolve, trepidation and all the other elements that might otherwise keep investors out of trouble. Instead,

63. Charlie Munger gave a great quotation on this subject, from Demosthenes: “Nothing is easier than self-deceit. For what each man wishes, that he also believes to be true.”

64. Time and time again, the postmortems of financial debacles include two classic phrases: “It was too good to be true” and “What were they thinking?”

65. No strategy can produce high rates of return without risk.

66. The fourth psychological contributor to investor error is the tendency to conform to the view of the herd rather than resist—even when the herd’s view

67. The force of greed might be, always spurring people to strive for more and more, the impact is even stronger when they compare themselves to others.

68. The sixth key influence is ego.

69. They have their egos in check. This, in my opinion, is the greatest formula for long-term wealth creation— but it doesn’t provide much ego gratification in the short run.

70. The desire for more, the fear of missing out, the tendency to compare against others, the influence of the crowd and the dream of the sure thing—these factors are near universal.

### Contrarianism

71. The key to investment success has to lie in doing the opposite: in diverging from the crowd. Those who recognize the errors that others make can profit enormously through contrarianism.

72. It’s our job as contrarians to catch falling knives, hopefully with care and skill.

### Finding bargains

73. The best opportunities are usually found among things most others won’t do.

74. Whenever “everyone” feels there’s no merit in something, it’s reasonable to suspect it’s unloved, unpursued and thus possibly underpriced.

75. as with so many things, the optimism that drives one to be an active investor and the skepticism that emerges from the presumption of market efficiency must be balanced.

### Patient opportunism

76. The market’s not a very accommodating machine; it won’t provide high returns just because you need them.

77. Patient opportunism—waiting for bargains—is often your best strategy.

78. An opportunist buys things because they’re offered at bargain prices.

79. It makes perfect sense that we must invest appropriately for the circumstances with which we’re presented. In fact, nothing else makes sense at all.

80. You want to take risk when others are fleeing from it, not when they’re competing with you to do so.

81. The absolute best buying opportunities come when asset holders are forced to sell, and in those crises they were present in large numbers.

82. The real goal of active investment management is to buy things for less than they’re worth. This is what the efficient market hypothesis says we can’t do. The theory’s objection seems reasonable: why should someone part with something at a bargain price, especially if the potential seller is informed and rational?

### Knowing what you don't know

83. We have two classes of forecasters: Those who don’t know—and those who don’t know they don’t know - John Kenneth Galbraith

84. It’s frightening to think that you might not know something, but more frightening to think that, by and large, the world is run by people who have faith that they know exactly what’s going on - Amos Tversky

85. The prediction of global crisis in 2007–2008 would have had great potential value. But if you saw that it came from someone who wasn’t right consistently—and someone with a visible negative bias—would you have acted? That’s the trouble with inconsistent forecasters: not that they’re never right, but that the record isn’t positive enough to inspire action on their occasional brainstorms.

86. One key question investors have to answer is whether they view the future as knowable or unknowable.

87. Investors who feel they know what the future holds will act assertively: making directional bets, concentrating positions, levering holdings and counting on future growth—in other words, doing things that in the absence of foreknowledge would increase risk.

88. Those who feel they don’t know what the future holds will act quite differently: diversifying, hedging, levering less (or not at all), emphasizing value today over growth tomorrow, staying high in the capital structure, and generally girding for a variety of possible outcomes.

89. The first group of investors did much better in the years leading up to the crash. But the second group was better prepared when the crash unfolded, and they had more capital available (and more-intact psyches) with which to profit from purchases made at its nadir.

90. Mark Twain put it best: “It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.”

91. Acknowledging the boundaries of what you can know—and working within those limits rather than venturing beyond—can give you a great advantage.

### Having a sense for where we stand

92. We may never know where we’re going, but we’d better have a good idea where we are.

93. Accept that the future isn’t knowable, throw up our hands, and simply ignore cycles. Instead of trying to predict them, we could try to make good investments and hold them throughout.

### Appreciating the role of luck

94. Every once in a while, someone makes a risky bet on an improbable or uncertain outcome and ends up looking like a genius. But we should recognize that it happened because of luck and boldness, not skill.

95. A good decision is one that’s optimal at the time it’s made, when the future is by definition unknown.

### Investing defensively

96. Concentration (the opposite of diversification) and leverage are two examples of offense. They’ll add to returns when they work but prove harmful when they don’t:

97. The amount of risk you’ll bear is a function of the extent to which you choose to pursue return.

98. The critical element in defensive investing is what Warren Buffett calls “margin of safety” or “margin for error.”

99. You find something you think will be worth $100. If you buy it for $90, you have a good chance of gain, as well as a moderate chance of loss in case your assumptions turn out to be too optimistic. But if you buy it for $70 instead of $90, your chance of loss is less. That $20 reduction provides additional room to be wrong and still come out okay. Low price is the ultimate source of margin for error.

100.  Caution can help us avoid mistakes, but it can also keep us from great accomplishments.

101.  Defense can provide good returns achieved consistently, while offense may consist of dreams that often go unmet.

### Avoiding pitfalls

102. An investor needs do very few things right as long as he avoids big mistakes. WARREN BUFFETT

103. For example, double sixes should come up once in every 36 rolls of the dice. But they can come up five times in a row—and never again in the next 175 rolls—and in the long run have occurred as often as they’re supposed to.

104. Investors make investments only because they expect them to work out, and their analysis will center on the likely scenarios.

105. it’s worth noting that the assumption that something can’t happen has the potential to make it happen, since people who believe it can’t happen will engage in risky behavior and thus alter the environment.

106. When capital is scarce and in demand, investors are faced with allocation choices regarding the best use for their capital, and they get to make their decisions with patience and discipline. But when there’s too much capital chasing too few ideas, investments will be made that do not deserve to be made.

107. When capital is in oversupply, investors compete for deals by accepting low returns and a slender margin for error.

108. Widespread disregard for risk creates great risk. “Nothing can go wrong.” “No price is too high.” “Someone will always pay me more for it.” “If I don’t move quickly, someone else will buy it.” Statements like these indicate that risk is being given short shrift.

109. In heady times, capital is devoted to innovative investments, many of which fail the test of time.

110. Psychological and technical factors can swamp fundamentals.

111. Loss of confidence and resolve can cause investors to sell at the bottom, converting downward fluctuations into permanent losses and preventing them from participating fully in the subsequent recovery.

112. Acting in the opposite direction requires the adoption of a contrarian position, with the loneliness and feeling of being wrong that it can bring for long periods.

113. When investor psychology is at equilibrium and fear and greed are balanced, asset prices are likely to be fair relative to value.

### Adding value

114. The performance of investors who add value is asymmetrical. The percentage of the market’s gain they capture is higher than the percentage of loss they suffer.

115. Let’s say, then, that all equity investors start not with a blank sheet of paper but rather with the possibility of simply emulating an index.

116. If we’re consistently able to decline less when the market declines and also participate fully when the market rises, this can be attributable to only one thing: alpha, or skill.

### Reasonable expectations

117. To achieve superior investment results, your insight into value has to be superior. Thus you must learn things others don’t, see things differently or do a better job of analyzing them—ideally, all three.

118. Only a strong sense of value will give you the discipline needed to take profits on a highly appreciated asset that everyone thinks will rise nonstop, or the guts to hold and average down in a crisis even as prices go lower every day. Of course, for your efforts in these regards to be profitable, your estimate of value has to be on target.

119. The relationship between price and value holds the ultimate key to investment success. Buying below value is the most dependable route to profit.

120. Outstanding buying opportunities exist primarily because perception understates reality. Whereas high quality can be readily apparent, it takes keen insight to detect cheapness.

121. The superior investor never forgets that the goal is to find good buys, not good assets.

122. Risk aversion—an appropriate amount of which is the essential ingredient in a rational market—is sometimes in short supply and sometimes excessive. The fluctuation of investor psychology in this regard plays a very important part in the creation of market bubbles and crashes.

123. “Being too far ahead of your time is indistinguishable from being wrong.” It can require patience and fortitude to hold positions long enough to be proved right.

124. “If we avoid the losers, the winners will take care of themselves,”

125. “Never forget the six-foot-tall man who drowned crossing the stream that was five feet deep on average.” Margin for error gives you staying power and gets you through the low spots.

126. in the good years, defensive investors have to be content with the knowledge that their gains, although perhaps less than maximal, were achieved with risk protection in place . . . even though it turned out not to be needed.

### Pulling it all together.

127. to conclude that investors truly add value, we have to see how they perform in environments to which their style isn’t particularly well suited.
