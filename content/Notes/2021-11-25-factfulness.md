While browsing the web around data visualization, someone recommended Hans Rosling's TED talk. You must watch the video if you like visualization or you like listening to story. While learning about him, I came across this book Factfulness.

## Introduction

The author starts with a quiz, to evaluate our view on world's progress (or the lack of it). The quiz has 13 questions with 3 choices to choose from, ranging from 'where does the majority of world population lives' to 'climate experts believe that over the next 100 years the average temperature will...'.

The questions might look simple, but according to author the majority of participants scored not even one-third. Statistically, a Chimp can do better than the participants. The sample size of participants ranges from CEOs to college graduates, policy makers to politicians.

> Only actively wrong 'knowledge' can make us score so badly - Hans Rosling

Our cravings for sugar and fat make obesity one of the largest health problems in the world today. We have to teach our children and ourselves to stay away from sweets and chips. In the same way, our quick-thinking brain's cravings for drama - our dramatic instincts are causing misconceptions and an overdramatic world view.

## Chapter 1: The Gap Instinct

1. _Gap Instinct_ - We humans have a strong dramatic instinct toward binary thinking, a basic urge to divide things into 2 distinct groups, with nothing but an empty gap in between.

> Child Mortality rate measure takes temperature of whole society. Because children are fragile, there are so many things that can kill them. It measures the quality of a society.

2. When put in a chart we won't find any country where the child mortality has increased. Because the world in general is getting better.

3. The world is not split into 2 parts, like _west and rest_, or _developed and under-developed_. Instead we should have 4 levels based on income levels. _Level 1_ being lowest income country and _level 4_ being the one with highest income.

4. Misconceptions disappear only if there is some equally simple but more relevant way of thinking to replace them.

5. **How to control Gap Instinct**
   1. Beware of averages - if we could check the spreads we would find they overlap. There is probably no gap at all.
   2. Beware of comparison of extremes - In all groups of countries/people, there are some at top and bottom. The majority is somewhere in between, where the gap is supposed to be.
   3. The view from up here - Looking from above distorts the view.

## Chapter 2: The Negativity Instinct

6. Negativity Instinct is our tendency to notice the bad more than good.

7. You never trust the data 100%. There is always some uncertainty.

8. The misconception that the world is getting worse is very difficult to maintain when we put the present in its historical context.

9. The news constantly alerts us with bad events in present. The doom-laden feeling that this creates in then intensified by our inability to remember the past; we fail to recall there were same number of negative events 1 year ago or 10 years ago.

10. Educating Girls - has proven to be one of the world's best-ever ideas.

- When women are educated, the workforce gets diversified and able to make better decisions and solve more problems.
- Educated mothers decide to have fewer children and more children survive.
- More energy and time is invested in each child's education.
- It's a virtuous cycle.

11. The lose of hope is probably the most devastating consequence of the negativity instinct and the ignorance it causes.

12. When we hang onto rose-tinted version of history we deprive ourselves and our children of the truth. The evidence about the terrible past is scary, but it is a great resource. It can help us to appreciate what we have today and provide us with hope.

13. **To control Negativity instinct**
    1. Better and bad - Convince yourselves that things can be both better and bad
    2. Good news in not news - Good news is almost never reported. So, news is almost always bad.
    - On seeing bad news, ask whether equally positive news would have reached you.
    3. Gradual improvement is not a news - We notice dips when we see gradual improvement with periodic dips, even though the improvement is gradual and steady.
    4. Beware of rosy pasts - People glorifies their early experiences, and nations glorifies their history.

## Chapter 3: The Straight Line Instinct

14. Only proven method for curbing population growth is to eradicate extreme poverty and give people better lives, including education and contrceptives.

15. Recognising that a line will just continue straight and remembering that such lines are rare in reality is part of factfulness

16. **To avoid strainght line instinct**
    1. Most of trends do not follow straight lines, instead they are S-curce, slides, humps and et al.

## Chapter 4: The Fear Instinct

17. When we are afraid, we do not see clearly.

18. Critical thinking is always difficult, but it's almost impossible when we are scared. There's no room for facts when our minds are occupied by fear.

19. Fears once helped keep our ancestors alive, today help keep journalists employed.

20. Disasters hit countries on all income levels, but the harm done is very different. With more money comes better preparedness.

21. The fear instinct is strong that it can make people collaborate across the worls, to make greatest progress.

22. Ask yourself..
    > What kind of evidence could change my mind about vaccination?

    > If the answer is 'no evidence could ever change my mind about vaccination', then you're putting yourself outside the evidence based reality.


23. Fear can be useful, but only if it is directed at the right things.
24. It makes us give our attention to the unlikely dangers that we are most afraid of, and neglect what is actually most risky.

25. **To control fear instinct**
    1. Fear vs Reality - The world is scarier than it is because of what we hear about is selected - by our own attention filter or by the media
    2. Risk = Danger x Exposure - The risk something poses to you depends not on how scared it makes us feel, but a combination of - "how dangerous?" and "how much are we exposed?"
    3. Calm before you carry on - Make few decisions as possible until the panic subsidised

## Chapter 5: The Size Instinct


26. The world cannot be understood without numbers. And it cannot be understood with numbers alone.

27. **To control Size instinct**
    1. Compare - Always look for comparisons. Ideally, divide by something.
    2. 80-20 Rule - Look for few largest items and deal with those first
    3. Divide - Look for rate per person when comparing between coutries or regions
## Chapter 6: The Generalization Instinct

28. We automatically categorises and generalises all the time.

29. If we were seeing every item as unique, we may not have a language to describe the world around us.

30. Flaking walls keep away the richer patients and their time consuming demands for costly treatments, allowing hospitals to use their limited resources to treat more people in more cost-effective ways

31. **To control Generalization instinct**


    1. Look for difference wihtin a group - Split he groups into smaller chunks
    2. Look for similarities across the groups
    3. Look for differences across the groups
    4. Beware of majority - MAjority just means more than half - 51-49 and 99-1 are not same

    5. Beware of vivid examples - Vivid examples are easier to recall but they might be the exception rather than the rule.
    6. Assume people are not idiots - When something looks strange, be curious and humble and think, in what way is this a smart solution?



## Chapter 7: The Destiny Instinct

32. Nothing is fixed or destined.

33. **To control destiny instinct**
    1. Keep track of gradual improvements
    2. Update your knowledge
    3. Collect examples of cultural changes
## Chapter 8: The Single Perspective Instinct

34. Having a single persepective can limit your imagination

35. **To control Sigle Perspective instinct**
    1. Test your ideas: Have people who disagree with you
    2. Hammers and nails: For hammer everything looks like a nail. Be ready to acquire more tools, with different functionalities
    3. Numbers, but not only numbers: Love numbers for what they tell about real lives


    4. Beware of simple ideas and simple solutions: History is full of visinaries who used simple utopian visions to justify terrible actions

## Chapter 9: The Blame Instinct

  36. Blame instinct is an instinct to find a clear, simple reason for why something bad has happened.


37.  **To control blame instinct**
    1. Look for causes, not villains
    2. Look for systems, not heroes

## Chapter 10: The Urgency Instinct

  38. When a problem seems urgent the first thing to do is not to cry wolf, but to organise data.

  39.  **To control Urgency instinct**
        1. Take a breath: Ask for more time and more information
        2. Insist on data: If something is urgent and important, it should be measured. Only relevant and accurate data is useful
        3. Beware of fortune-tellers: Any prediction about future is uncertain.
        4. Be wary of drastic action: Ask what the side effects will be. Ask how the idea has been tested.
