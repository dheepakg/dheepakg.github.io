This podcast is hosted by [Jack Rhysider](https://twitter.com/JackRhysider). Each of the episodes deals with events in cyberspace.


My favourite episode is the one that covered the Bangladesh Bank Heist.

There is no coding involved, Jack explains the _strange/new_ words in layman terms. You should give a try if you're curious about what's happening in cyber space.

PS: Darknet Diaries has no relation with the [darknet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet), the one accessed through Tor.
