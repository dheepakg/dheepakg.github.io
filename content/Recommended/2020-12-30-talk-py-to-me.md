This is the 1<sup>st</sup> ever podcast that I started with. I'm listening to the show regularly since 2017, yet I couldn't recall how I got introduced to this show.

According to the [talkpython.fm](https://talkpython.fm/),
  >> Talk Python to Me is a weekly podcast hosted by Michael Kennedy. The show covers a wide array of Python topics as well as many related topics (e.g. MongoDB, AngularJS, DevOps).

Michael Kennedy hosts this show and he conducts [trainings](https://training.talkpython.fm/) as well. This is the _most popular_ podcast on Python programming language.

Some of the hosts includes,
 * Al Sweigart of _Automate the boring stuff with Python_
 * Dan Bader of _Real Python_
 * Matthiass​ ​Bussonnier of _Project Jupyter_
 * Jake VanderPlas of _Altair_





My favourite episode is the one with Real Python's [Dan Bader](https://dbader.org/) on top 10 articles of 2019.
