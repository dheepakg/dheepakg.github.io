Hey there!

I am Dheepak. I am a self-taught developer and I have been programming since 2014. I write SQL for food and Python for fun. Outside of work, I am a confused bloke. In terms of food, I love dosa, and Blackcurrant (yea, it tastes like cough syrup) flavored ice cream. I tweet a lot.

I read books, self-help being the least favorite. Have a peek into my [shelf](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/8815523) or my [Pocket recommendations](https://getpocket.com/@dh0A9g0GdTt9dTX3f0ps447pn3T6d120GO9x88I709a7e1A263925b7dJaNwqg61).

Somehow in '14, got attracted to Python. From then slowly learning the nuts and bolts of Python. Now, I'll say I'm intermediate fluency in Python.

I love history. Politically a libertarian, believing state and religion should stay apart. Trying to be a rebel child, I did thought Communism is a right way to go. Then the reality slapped hard, enrolled into Capitalism.

A DC fan. A Sherlockian. I love stories - podcast, blogs, vlogs, books or documentaries.

This was started to be a personal blog about my opinions. This is hosted in GitHub and built using ~~Jekyll~~ ~~Pelican~~ Hugo. I'm plannig to add my side projects in near future.

While strolling in the WWW, I come across things worth noting down [_woah_](/woah/).
